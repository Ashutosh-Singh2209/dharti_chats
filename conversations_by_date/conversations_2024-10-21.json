Insecticides like chlorpyrifos, fipronil, or flonicamid can be effective. Apply treatments to the soil to eliminate insects and protect the plant. Spraying applications can be done 30, 45, and 60 days after sowing using products like Chlorantraniliprole + Lambda-Cyhalothrin (0.5ml/l), Lambda-Cyhalothrin (1ml/l), or Cypermethrin (1ml/l).\n\n2. **Downy Mildew of Grape** (Unlikely Diagnosis)\n   - **Symptoms**: \n     - Yellowish-green oily spots with brown halos on leaves.\n     - Irregular brown patches.\n     - White to grayish cottony growth under the spots.\n     - Can affect shoots and inflorescence.\n   - **Treatment**: Use protectant fungicides, especially copper-based ones like Bordeaux mixture.
