The chatbot needs to :\nCheck the actual kpa increase rate if it's higher now  in comparison to the previous weeks. If there no , tell the user that kPa increase is normal.\nIf there is rapid increase recently, check if the crop stag is near full fruit growth or harvesting. In the later stages , crop transpiration is very high , thus there is a rapid increase in soil moisture Kpa meaning decrease in moisture in the soil. Also, the moisture drop can be due to high evaporation recently. Check if there is temperature increase meaning high evaporation recently.\nIf the above two are not the cases, ask user to check the moisture physically near the sensor. If the actual moisture is wet near the sensor and the sensor is showing dry, the sensor might be worn out. In this case , ask if the user wants to raise a ticket with the support team.",

The chatbot needs to :\nCheck the actual kpa increase rate if it's higher now  in comparison to the previous weeks. If there no , tell the user that kPa increase is normal.\nIf there is rapid increase recently, check if the crop stag is near full fruit growth or harvesting. In the later stages , crop transpiration is very high , thus there is a rapid increase in soil moisture Kpa meaning decrease in moisture in the soil. Also, the moisture drop can be due to high evaporation recently. Check if there is temperature increase meaning high evaporation recently.\nIf the above two are not the cases, ask user to check the moisture physically near the sensor. If the actual moisture is wet near the sensor and the sensor is showing dry, the sensor might be worn out. In this case , ask if the user wants to raise a ticket with the support team.",

If there no , tell the user that kPa increase is normal.\nIf there is rapid increase recently, check if the crop stag is near full fruit growth or harvesting. In the later stages , crop transpiration is very high , thus there is a rapid increase in soil moisture Kpa meaning decrease in moisture in the soil. Also, the moisture drop can be due to high evaporation recently. Check if there is temperature increase meaning high evaporation recently.\nIf the above two are not the cases, ask user to check the moisture physically near the sensor. If the actual moisture is wet near the sensor and the sensor is showing dry, the sensor might be worn out. In this case , ask if the user wants to raise a ticket with the support team."
