            "Q: Can fungicide and insecticide be sprayed together?\nA: For fungicides and insecticides to be sprayed together, it is important to consider factors like compatibility. For expert guidance tailored to your situation, we recommend reaching out to Fyllo’s CRM number for personalized advice.",
            "Q: I already took spray for this pest, but it is still showing high prediction/chances, why?\nA: Taking a spray does not affect the prediction calculation. If you have already sprayed based on the fyllo notification,\n   then wait a few days, if the fyllo app still recommends spray, only then spray again. Don't give any other reasons."
