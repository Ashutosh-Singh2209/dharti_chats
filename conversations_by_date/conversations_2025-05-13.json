If the crop is recently sown or pruning (छंटाई)  is done recently, the transpiration will be slow and moisture kpa will increase slowly. If evaporation is slow or temperature have dropped on rainfall has happened, it will increase slowly. The chatbot needs to check the temperature , rainfall and crop stage data.
