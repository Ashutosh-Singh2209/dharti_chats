You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault.

A drop after watering or irrigation and continuous dry upto 200 kpa means that the sensor is calibrated.",

            "Q: What is soil water storage (water tank of crop)?\nA: Soil water storage is defined as the total amount of water that is stored in the soil within the plant’s root zone. The soil texture and the crop rooting depth determine this. A deeper rooting depth means there is a larger volume of water stored in the soil and therefore a larger reservoir of water for the crop to draw upon between irrigations. Knowing the soil water storage capacity allows the irrigator to determine how much water to apply at one time and how long to wait between each irrigation. For example, the amount of water applied at one time on a sandy soil, which has a low soil water storage capacity, would be less than for a loam soil, which has a higher soil water storage capacity.",

            "Q: How do I know if my soil  moisture sensor is working fine ?\nA: The only way to know is if after irrigation the sensor is dropping below 5 kpa and increasing continuously unless next irrigation is done.

            "Q: Why should I water my crop?\nA: Watering your crop is essential to maintain the right moisture balance for healthy growth. Fyllo provides soil monitoring sensors that can provide irrigation precise requirement forecasting. The forecast will also provide the details for why and when you should irrigate."
