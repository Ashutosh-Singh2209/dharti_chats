This allows the boron solution to be mixed with the irrigation water and delivered directly to the root zone of the plants.\n\n4. **Timing**: Apply the boron solution during the irrigation cycle when the plants are actively growing, preferably during the flowering and fruiting stages for cucumbers.\n\n5. **Monitor**: After application, monitor the plants for any signs of boron deficiency or toxicity. Adjust future applications based on plant response and soil tests.\n\n6. **Flush the System**: After applying the boron solution, flush the drip irrigation system with clean water to prevent any buildup or clogging.\n\nAlways follow local agricultural guidelines and consult with an agronomist if unsure about the specific requirements for your crop.",

            "Q: How do I know if my soil  moisture sensor is working fine ?\nA: The only way to know is if after irrigation the sensor is dropping below 5 kpa and increasing continuously unless next irrigation is done. You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault. If the soil moisture sensor reading is consistently at 0 from few 48 hours, then it could be anamolous (use live and historical hourly soil moisture data (use tool) to validate).",
            "Q: How much kPa should be set for a 4-inch depth soil moisture sensor?\nA: The kPa value for a 4-inch depth soil moisture sensor should be set based on the **soil type** and **crop requirements**. Here are general guidelines for different soil types:\n\n### **Sandy Soil:**\n- **Optimal range:** 10–20 kPa\n- **Irrigation threshold:** Above 30 kPa\n\n### **Loamy Soil (Silty or Mixed):**\n- **Optimal range:** 20–40 kPa\n- **Irrigation threshold:** Above 50 kPa\n\n### **Clay Soil:**\n- **Optimal range:** 40–70 kPa\n- **Irrigation threshold:** Above 80 kPa\n\n### **Additional Considerations:**\n- For **sensitive crops** like vegetables, maintain lower kPa thresholds to avoid water stress.\n- For **deep-rooted crops**, kPa values may vary at different depths; calibrate accordingly.\n- **Calibration** of the sensor to your specific soil and crop is essential for accuracy.\n\nConsulting with an agronomist or referring to crop-specific irrigation guides will help you fine-tune the kPa range.",
            "Q: In the latest irrigation , sensor didn't drop to 0.\nA: 0 to 5 Kpa means soil is fully wet. It need not drop to 0 every time. Moisture less than 5 also means wet conditions. So, need not worry. Also ask to wait for 12 hours after irrigation.",
            "Q: My  sensor is showing 0 Kpa for long.\nA: 0-5 kPa means wet soil. It can be due to following :\nIf the device is recently installed, there can be moisture  around the sensor because the sensor is dipped in the water before installing. If this is the case, ask them to do atleast 3 irrigations as per their previous schedule without sensors and sensors would b set by then.\nIf the crop stage is very early or pruing is done recently, the water takeup by plants is negligible in this period because of very less transpiration. If this is the case, ask them to wait till irrigation Kpa in the present stage.\nSometimes, the water can remain accumulated around the sensor due to local landscaping or slope in the land around sensor. In this case, please check the around the sensor. It will have to be reinstalled properly. Chatbot should ask the user if he wants to create an issue ticket for the same",
            "Q: When should I water? (Hindi: Paani kab dun?)\nA: 0-5 kPa is wet, and increasing kPa means increasing dryness. The crop should stay in its optimal moisture zone, and when very close or above the dry optimal moisture, water can be given. Check internal irrigation forecast for the correct answer."
