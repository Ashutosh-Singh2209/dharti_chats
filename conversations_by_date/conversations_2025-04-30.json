Is my device sending data? Are my all devices working properly? Is my device online? Is my device connected? What is the status of my device? Is my Fyllo device transmitting data?\nA: If device is sending data proactively, then it is working fine. If user has not recharged the device, then it will not work, and user should do recharge. If recharge is also active, then there is some issue, user should raise a support ticket in the Fyllo App.\n\nI'll check the payment status of your device for you.\n\nTool Selection: I should use the JSON data from farmer_plots_details to check:\n1. If isDataPlanActive is true\n2. If planRechargeExpiryDate is in the future\n3. If deviceLatestDataAvailable is true\n4. What the deviceMessage says\n\nResponse Logic:\n- If isDataPlanActive is true AND planRechargeExpiryDate is future date:\n  \"Your recharge plan is active until [expiry date].\"\n- If isDataPlanActive is false OR planRechargeExpiryDate is past date:\n  \"It appears your recharge plan is not currently active. If you've recently made a payment, please allow some time for it to be processed. If the issue persists, please contact our support team. Would you like the contact details of our support team?\"\n- Additionally, if deviceLatestDataAvailable is true:\n  \"Your device is currently active and sending data properly.\"\n- If deviceLatestDataAvailable is false:\n  \"Your device is not currently sending data. This might be due to connectivity issues.\"\n\nExample final response:\n\"Your payment has been successfully processed. Your recharge plan is active until June 5, 2025.

            "Q: The moisture (kpa) is increasing very fast  recently and it is asking to irrigate frequently.\nA:  Kpa is increasing fast it means that sensors are drying rapidly.  The chatbot needs to :\nCheck the actual kpa increase rate if it's higher now  in comparison to the previous weeks. If there no , tell the user that kPa increase is normal.\nIf there is rapid increase recently, check if the crop stag is near full fruit growth or harvesting. In the later stages , crop transpiration is very high , thus there is a rapid increase in soil moisture Kpa meaning decrease in moisture in the soil. Also, the moisture drop can be due to high evaporation recently. Check if there is temperature increase meaning high evaporation recently.\nIf the above two are not the cases, ask user to check the moisture physically near the sensor. If the actual moisture is wet near the sensor and the sensor is showing dry, the sensor might be worn out. In this case , ask if the user wants to raise a ticket with the support team.",
            "Q: My  sensor is showing 0 Kpa for long.\nA: 0-5 kPa means wet soil. It can be due to following :\nIf the device is recently installed, there can be moisture  around the sensor because the sensor is dipped in the water before installing. If this is the case, ask them to do atleast 3 irrigations as per their previous schedule without sensors and sensors would b set by then.\nIf the crop stage is very early or pruing is done recently, the water takeup by plants is negligible in this period because of very less transpiration. If this is the case, ask them to wait till irrigation Kpa in the present stage.\nSometimes, the water can remain accumulated around the sensor due to local landscaping or slope in the land around sensor. In this case, please check the around the sensor. It will have to be reinstalled properly. Chatbot should ask the user if he wants to create an issue ticket for the same",
            "Q: The moisture (kpa) is increasing slowly recently.\nA: Need to check for current stage and evapotranspiration rate. If the crop is recently sown or pruning (छंटाई)  is done recently, the transpiration will be slow and moisture kpa will increase slowly. If evaporation is slow or temperature have dropped on rainfall has happened, it will increase slowly. The chatbot needs to check the temperature , rainfall and crop stage data. And advise if there is any reason for the slow increase.\nIf still there is some confusion, the chatbot needs to ask user to check moisture around the sensor by digging and then ask  the user if he wants to create an issue ticket for the same."
