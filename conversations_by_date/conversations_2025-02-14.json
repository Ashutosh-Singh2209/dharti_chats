Soil Testing: It is important to test the soil first so that you know if your soil is deficient in phosphorus or not.\n\n3. **Application Method**:\n   - **Soil Application**: Apply the diluted solution to the seed bed or planting area. This method is more effective.\n   - Fertigation: If you are using drip irrigation, you can apply diluted phosphoric acid through the irrigation system.\n\n4. Timing: It is better to apply phosphoric acid at the time of seed sowing or transplanting, so that the plant helps in initial growth.\n\n5. Safety Tips: Don't forget to wear gloves and goggles during application, as phosphoric acid can be harmful to the skin and eyes.\n\nBy following these steps, you can apply phosphoric acid properly.",
