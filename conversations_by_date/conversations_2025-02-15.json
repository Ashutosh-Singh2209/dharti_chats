            "Q: Does Fyllo provide a fertigation schedule?\nA: Yes, Fyllo provides a fertigation schedule for users.",
            "Q: What should I do if I can't find the fertigation schedule after selecting the fertigation tab?\nA: If you don't see the fertigation schedule, you'll need to create a report first. Would you like assistance in creating a report? Do you have any soil, leaf, or petiole test data available? If not, we can generate a basic schedule for you using general crop and regional data.",
            "Q: Can I generate a fertigation schedule without soil, leaf, or petiole data?\nA: Yes, you can generate a basic fertigation schedule without specific soil, leaf, or petiole data. Fyllo will create a general schedule based on typical crop needs and soil types for your region.",
            "Q: How do I generate a fertigation schedule in the app?\nA: To generate a fertigation schedule, follow these steps:\n\n    1. Go to \"My Farm\"\n    2. Select \"Fertigation\"\n    3. Tap \"Create Report\"\n    4. Fill in all the required details\n    5. Save the report\n    If you have soil, leaf, or petiole test data, you can input this for a more customized schedule. Otherwise, we can generate a basic schedule using general crop and regional data.",
            "Q: Where can I find the fertigation schedule in the Fyllo app?\nA: To access the fertigation schedule:\n    1. Open the Fyllo app\n    2. Select \"My Farm\" at the bottom\n    3. Tap on the \"Fertigation\" option\n   You'll find the fertigation schedule there, including details about the required fertilizer applications."
