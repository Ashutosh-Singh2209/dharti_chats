            "Q: I irrigated still the sensor is showing dry.\nA: Ask user when he irrigated. It usually takes 12 hours to reach the water till sensor. If the sensor is not dropping even after 12 hours, it can be due to one of the following reasons :\nWater is not reaching properly till the sensor , this can be due to drip blocked , or slope in the land or dripper outlets far away from the sensor. Ask user to check if drip is fine and  dripper is within the range of sensor. \nThe sensor can be very old , more than two years , in this case , the sensor might be malfunction, ask user if he wants to raise a ticket",
            "Q: What should I do if the soil moisture sensor always shows dry values?\nA: Check if irrigation water is reaching the sensor, verify sensor connection, and ensure the sensor is not damaged.",
            "Q: I irrigated still the sensor is dropping slowly.\nA: Sometimes, the water reaches slowly till root zone and the moisture sensor kPa value drops slowly. Always wait for 12 hours after irrigation for the moisture to saturate. If still some confusion, ask user to check moisture near the sensor and check if he wants to raise a ticket for the issue.",
            "Q: How do I know if my soil  moisture sensor is working fine ?\nA: The only way to know is if after irrigation the sensor is dropping below 5 kpa and increasing continuously unless next irrigation is done. You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault. If the soil moisture sensor reading is consistently at 0 from few 48 hours, then it could be anamolous (use live and historical hourly soil moisture data (use tool) to validate).",
            "Q: Sensor is showing dry, but it rained recently.\nA: Rainwater doesn't percolate well in the soil. Most of it runs off. After a day of rain stops , if the sensor is still dry, you will have to irrigate. You can check the moisture by digging near the sensor . Irrigate accordingly."
