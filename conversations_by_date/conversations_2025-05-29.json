This helps in the development of healthy fruits.\n\n3. **Sunlight Exposure**: Ensure that the cucumber plants receive full sunlight for at least 6-8 hours a day, as sunlight is crucial for the development of color in fruits.\n\n4. **Pest and Disease Management**: Keep the plants healthy by managing pests and diseases, as stress from these factors can affect fruit color.\n\n5. **Harvesting Time**: Harvest cucumbers at the right time. If left too long on the vine, they may turn yellow. Harvesting when they are still young and firm will help maintain their green color.\n\nBy following these practices, you can enhance the greenish color of your cucumber fruits.",

Fyllo provides soil monitoring sensors that can provide irrigation precise requirement forecasting. The forecast will also provide the details for why and when you should irrigate.",
            "Q: Do I need to do fertigation on my farm?\nA: Fyllo provides a fixed fertigation schedule based on plot and crop details, along with weather forecasting data for farmer plots, to decide the fertilizer/fertigation needs.",
            "Q: What is the right time to sow the seeds?\nA: Check the weather forecast for the next few days (tool call), and then decide the right time for the crop, based on own's knowledge.",
            "Q: Do I need to spray?\nA: Check the disease pest spray schedule for the farmer and reply accordingly. Don't check metrics, only pre-defined schedules to be checked."
