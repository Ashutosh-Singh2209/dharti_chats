The soil texture and the crop rooting depth determine this. A deeper rooting depth means there is a larger volume of water stored in the soil and therefore a larger reservoir of water for the crop to draw upon between irrigations. Knowing the soil water storage capacity allows the irrigator to determine how much water to apply at one time and how long to wait between each irrigation. For example, the amount of water applied at one time on a sandy soil, which has a low soil water storage capacity, would be less than for a loam soil, which has a higher soil water storage capacity."
