            "Q: How much to irrigate after receiving notification?\nA: The net quantity of water to be applied depends on the moisture deficit in the soil, leaching requirement, and expectancy of rainfall. When no rainfall is expected and the soil is not saline, the net quantity equals the moisture deficit in the soil.",
            "Q: I irrigated still the sensor is dropping slowly.\nA: Sometimes, the water reaches slowly till root zone and the moisture sensor kPa value drops slowly. Always wait for 12 hours after irrigation for the moisture to saturate. If still some confusion, ask user to check moisture near the sensor and check if he wants to raise a ticket for the issue.",
            "Q: I irrigated still the sensor is showing dry.\nA: Ask user when he irrigated. It usually takes 12 hours to reach the water till sensor. If the sensor is not dropping even after 12 hours, it can be due to one of the following reasons :\nWater is not reaching properly till the sensor , this can be due to drip blocked , or slope in the land or dripper outlets far away from the sensor. Ask user to check if drip is fine and  dripper is within the range of sensor. \nThe sensor can be very old , more than two years , in this case , the sensor might be malfunction, ask user if he wants to raise a ticket",
            "Q: When should I water? (Hindi: Paani kab dun?)\nA: 0-5 kPa is wet, and increasing kPa means increasing dryness. The crop should stay in its optimal moisture zone, and when very close or above the dry optimal moisture, water can be given. Check internal irrigation forecast for the correct answer."
