If the soil is wet but sensors indicate dryness, the sensors may need maintenance.\n\nWould you like to proceed with irrigation or need further assistance?",

How to use the irrigation hours calculator?\nA: To calculate irrigation hours in the Fyllo app, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the Fyllo App\n2. Go to the home screen\n3. Click on the soil moisture-1 sensor\n4. Scroll down to find the \"Irrigation hours\" section\n5. Fill in the required details such as:\n   - Root width (inches)\n   - Root depth (inches)\n   - Soil retention (mm)\n   - Dripper distance (feet)\n   - Dripper discharge (liters)\n6. Click the calculate button\n\nWould you like me to calculate the irrigation hours for you right now? I can retrieve your plot's irrigation settings and perform the calculation if you say yes.\n\nTool Selection: When user says yes, I should:\n1. Use get_irrigation_installation_settings tool to retrieve plot settings\n2. Check if all values are present and valid\n3. If values are valid, use calculate_irrigation_hours tool with these values\n4. If values are missing or invalid, ask the user to provide the missing values\n5. After calculating irrigation hours, display the irrigation installation settings that were used for the calculation\n6. Ask the user if they want to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values, and if yes, prompt them to provide those values\n\nExample response if values are missing:\n\"I checked your plot settings, but I need some additional information to calculate irrigation hours accurately. Could you please provide the [missing value(s)]? Once you provide these details, I can complete the calculation for you.\"\n\nExample response after calculation:\n\"Based on your plot's irrigation settings, the calculated irrigation hours are [X] hours. \n\nI used the following settings for this calculation:\n- Root width: [value] inches\n- Root depth: [value] inches\n- Soil retention: [value] mm\n- Dripper distance: [value] feet\n- Dripper discharge: [value] liters\n\nWould you like to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values?

            "Q: How do I know if my soil  moisture sensor is working fine ?\nA: The only way to know is if after irrigation the sensor is dropping below 5 kpa and increasing continuously unless next irrigation is done. You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault. If the soil moisture sensor reading is consistently at 0 from few 48 hours, then it could be anamolous (use live and historical hourly soil moisture data (use tool) to validate).",

            "Q: How much kPa should be set for a 4-inch depth soil moisture sensor?\nA: The kPa value for a 4-inch depth soil moisture sensor should be set based on the **soil type** and **crop requirements**. Here are general guidelines for different soil types:\n\n### **Sandy Soil:**\n- **Optimal range:** 10–20 kPa\n- **Irrigation threshold:** Above 30 kPa\n\n### **Loamy Soil (Silty or Mixed):**\n- **Optimal range:** 20–40 kPa\n- **Irrigation threshold:** Above 50 kPa\n\n### **Clay Soil:**\n- **Optimal range:** 40–70 kPa\n- **Irrigation threshold:** Above 80 kPa\n\n### **Additional Considerations:**\n- For **sensitive crops** like vegetables, maintain lower kPa thresholds to avoid water stress.\n- For **deep-rooted crops**, kPa values may vary at different depths; calibrate accordingly.\n- **Calibration** of the sensor to your specific soil and crop is essential for accuracy.\n\nConsulting with an agronomist or referring to crop-specific irrigation guides will help you fine-tune the kPa range.",
            "Q: How to calibrate soil moisture sensors ?\nA:  The way to calibrate sensors is by putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. A drop after watering or irrigation and continuous dry upto 200 kpa means that the sensor is calibrated."

The chatbot needs to :\nCheck the actual kpa increase rate if it's higher now  in comparison to the previous weeks. If there no , tell the user that kPa increase is normal.\nIf there is rapid increase recently, check if the crop stag is near full fruit growth or harvesting. In the later stages , crop transpiration is very high , thus there is a rapid increase in soil moisture Kpa meaning decrease in moisture in the soil. Also, the moisture drop can be due to high evaporation recently. Check if there is temperature increase meaning high evaporation recently.\nIf the above two are not the cases, ask user to check the moisture physically near the sensor. If the actual moisture is wet near the sensor and the sensor is showing dry, the sensor might be worn out. In this case , ask if the user wants to raise a ticket with the support team."
