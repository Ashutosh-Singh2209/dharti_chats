            "Q: How to calibrate soil moisture sensors ?\nA:  The way to calibrate sensors is by putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. A drop after watering or irrigation and continuous dry upto 200 kpa means that the sensor is calibrated.",

When no rainfall is expected and the soil is not saline, the net quantity equals the moisture deficit in the soil.",
            "Q: In the latest irrigation , sensor didn't drop to 0.\nA: 0 to 5 Kpa means soil is fully wet. It need not drop to 0 every time. Moisture less than 5 also means wet conditions. So, need not worry. Also ask to wait for 12 hours after irrigation.",

If the sensor is not dropping even after 12 hours, it can be due to one of the following reasons :\nWater is not reaching properly till the sensor , this can be due to drip blocked , or slope in the land or dripper outlets far away from the sensor. Ask user to check if drip is fine and  dripper is within the range of sensor. \nThe sensor can be very old , more than two years , in this case , the sensor might be malfunction, ask user if he wants to raise a ticket",

You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault.

            "Q: What is soil water storage (water tank of crop)?\nA: Soil water storage is defined as the total amount of water that is stored in the soil within the plant’s root zone. The soil texture and the crop rooting depth determine this. A deeper rooting depth means there is a larger volume of water stored in the soil and therefore a larger reservoir of water for the crop to draw upon between irrigations. Knowing the soil water storage capacity allows the irrigator to determine how much water to apply at one time and how long to wait between each irrigation. For example, the amount of water applied at one time on a sandy soil, which has a low soil water storage capacity, would be less than for a loam soil, which has a higher soil water storage capacity.",
            "Q: How much to irrigate after receiving notification?\nA: The net quantity of water to be applied depends on the moisture deficit in the soil, leaching requirement, and expectancy of rainfall. When no rainfall is expected and the soil is not saline, the net quantity equals the moisture deficit in the soil."

            "Q: How do I know if my soil  moisture sensor is working fine ?\nA: The only way to know is if after irrigation the sensor is dropping below 5 kpa and increasing continuously unless next irrigation is done. You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault. If the soil moisture sensor reading is consistently at 0 from few 48 hours, then it could be anamolous (use live and historical hourly soil moisture data (use tool) to validate).",
            "Q: In the latest irrigation , sensor didn't drop to 0.\nA: 0 to 5 Kpa means soil is fully wet. It need not drop to 0 every time. Moisture less than 5 also means wet conditions. So, need not worry. Also ask to wait for 12 hours after irrigation."
