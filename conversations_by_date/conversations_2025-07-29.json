Fyllo provides soil monitoring sensors that can provide irrigation precise requirement forecasting. The forecast will also provide the details for why and when you should irrigate.",
            "Q: When should I water? (Hindi: Paani kab dun?)\nA: 0-5 kPa is wet, and increasing kPa means increasing dryness. The crop should stay in its optimal moisture zone, and when very close or above the dry optimal moisture, water can be given. Check internal irrigation forecast for the correct answer.",

            "Q: How much to irrigate after receiving notification?\nA: The net quantity of water to be applied depends on the moisture deficit in the soil, leaching requirement, and expectancy of rainfall. When no rainfall is expected and the soil is not saline, the net quantity equals the moisture deficit in the soil."
