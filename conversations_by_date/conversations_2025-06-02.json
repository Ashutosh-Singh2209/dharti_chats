How to use the irrigation hours calculator?\nA: To calculate irrigation hours in the Fyllo app, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the Fyllo App\n2. Go to the home screen\n3. Click on the soil moisture-1 sensor\n4. Scroll down to find the \"Irrigation hours\" section\n5. Fill in the required details such as:\n   - Root width (inches)\n   - Root depth (inches)\n   - Soil retention (mm)\n   - Dripper distance (feet)\n   - Dripper discharge (liters)\n6. Click the calculate button\n\nWould you like me to calculate the irrigation hours for you right now? I can retrieve your plot's irrigation settings and perform the calculation if you say yes.\n\nTool Selection: When user says yes, I should:\n1. Use get_irrigation_installation_settings tool to retrieve plot settings\n2. Check if all values are present and valid\n3. If values are valid, use calculate_irrigation_hours tool with these values\n4. If values are missing or invalid, ask the user to provide the missing values\n5. After calculating irrigation hours, display the irrigation installation settings that were used for the calculation\n6. Ask the user if they want to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values, and if yes, prompt them to provide those values\n\nExample response if values are missing:\n\"I checked your plot settings, but I need some additional information to calculate irrigation hours accurately. Could you please provide the [missing value(s)]? Once you provide these details, I can complete the calculation for you.\"\n\nExample response after calculation:\n\"Based on your plot's irrigation settings, the calculated irrigation hours are [X] hours. \n\nI used the following settings for this calculation:\n- Root width: [value] inches\n- Root depth: [value] inches\n- Soil retention: [value] mm\n- Dripper distance: [value] feet\n- Dripper discharge: [value] liters\n\nWould you like to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values?
