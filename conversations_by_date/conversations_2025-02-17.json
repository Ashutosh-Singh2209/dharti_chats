Yeh beneficial microbes ke liye harmful ho sakta hai, jo ki soil health ke liye zaroori hain.\n\n5. **Plant Stress**: Agar pH mein bahut zyada variation hota hai, toh plants ko stress ho sakta hai, jo ki unki growth aur yield ko prabhavit kar sakta hai.\n\nIsliye, phosphoric acid ka istemal karte waqt soil pH ko dhyan mein rakhna zaroori hai. Soil test karwana aur agronomist se salah lena behtar hoga.",
        "en": "If you use phosphoric acid that has a Q4 rating, while your soil has a Q8.5, it can have a few effects:\n\n1. Soil Reduction: The use of phosphoric acid will help in reducing soil burn. However, if the soil F is too high (8.5), it may take time for it to get F to the right level.\n\n2. Nutrient availability: Low temperature increases the availability of phosphorus, but if the soil value is too high, it can reduce the availability of some nutrients (such as iron, manganese), which are essential for plant growth.\n\n3. Root Health: If the soil count is too high, the roots may be damaged. Controlling the fat with phosphoric acid can improve the health of the roots, but it has to be used carefully.\n\n4. Microbial activity: Sudden changes in soil fiber can affect microbial activity. It can be harmful to the beneficial microbe, which is essential for soil health.\n\n5. Plant stress: If there is too much variation in the F, the plant may become stressed, which can affect their growth and yield.\n\nTherefore, it is important to keep soil fat in mind when using phosphoric acid. It would be better to get a soil test done and consult an agronomist.",
