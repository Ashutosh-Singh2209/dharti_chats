However, here are some general practices to manage diseases in pomegranates:\n\n1. **Fungicides**: Use broad-spectrum fungicides to control fungal infections.\n2. **Insecticides**: If pests are suspected, consider using insecticides that target common pests affecting pomegranates.\n3. **Cultural Practices**: Ensure proper spacing and air circulation around plants, and remove any infected fruits to prevent the spread of disease.\n\nFor tailored recommendations, it's best to consult with a local agricultural expert or extension service. Providing clearer images of affected areas in the future can also help in better diagnosis and recommendations.",
