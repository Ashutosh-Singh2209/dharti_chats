If this is the case, ask them to do atleast 3 irrigations as per their previous schedule without sensors and sensors would b set by then.\nIf the crop stage is very early or pruing is done recently, the water takeup by plants is negligible in this period because of very less transpiration. If this is the case, ask them to wait till irrigation Kpa in the present stage.\nSometimes, the water can remain accumulated around the sensor due to local landscaping or slope in the land around sensor. In this case, please check the around the sensor. It will have to be reinstalled properly. Chatbot should ask the user if he wants to create an issue ticket for the same"

            "Q: How do I know if my soil  moisture sensor is working fine ?\nA: The only way to know is if after irrigation the sensor is dropping below 5 kpa and increasing continuously unless next irrigation is done. You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault. If the soil moisture sensor reading is consistently at 0 from few 48 hours, then it could be anamolous (use live and historical hourly soil moisture data (use tool) to validate).",
            "Q: How to calibrate soil moisture sensors ?\nA:  The way to calibrate sensors is by putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. A drop after watering or irrigation and continuous dry upto 200 kpa means that the sensor is calibrated.",
            "Q: How to measure/ calculate irrigation hours /water tank of my plot in fyllo app? How do I calculate irrigation hours for my plot? How to use the irrigation hours calculator?\nA: To calculate irrigation hours in the Fyllo app, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the Fyllo App\n2. Go to the home screen\n3. Click on the soil moisture-1 sensor\n4. Scroll down to find the \"Irrigation hours\" section\n5. Fill in the required details such as:\n   - Root width (inches)\n   - Root depth (inches)\n   - Soil retention (mm)\n   - Dripper distance (feet)\n   - Dripper discharge (liters)\n6. Click the calculate button\n\nWould you like me to calculate the irrigation hours for you right now? I can retrieve your plot's irrigation settings and perform the calculation if you say yes.\n\nTool Selection: When user says yes, I should:\n1. Use get_irrigation_installation_settings tool to retrieve plot settings\n2. Check if all values are present and valid\n3. If values are valid, use calculate_irrigation_hours tool with these values\n4. If values are missing or invalid, ask the user to provide the missing values\n5. After calculating irrigation hours, display the irrigation installation settings that were used for the calculation\n6. Ask the user if they want to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values, and if yes, prompt them to provide those values\n\nExample response if values are missing:\n\"I checked your plot settings, but I need some additional information to calculate irrigation hours accurately. Could you please provide the [missing value(s)]? Once you provide these details, I can complete the calculation for you.\"\n\nExample response after calculation:\n\"Based on your plot's irrigation settings, the calculated irrigation hours are [X] hours. \n\nI used the following settings for this calculation:\n- Root width: [value] inches\n- Root depth: [value] inches\n- Soil retention: [value] mm\n- Dripper distance: [value] feet\n- Dripper discharge: [value] liters\n\nWould you like to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values? If yes, please provide the new values you'd like to use.\"",
            "Q: What should I do if the soil moisture sensor values fluctuate?\nA: Ensure the sensor is installed properly in the soil, check for air bubbles, and contact Fyllo representative if the issue persists.",
            "Q: The moisture (kpa) is increasing very fast  recently and it is asking to irrigate frequently.\nA:  Kpa is increasing fast it means that sensors are drying rapidly.  The chatbot needs to :\nCheck the actual kpa increase rate if it's higher now  in comparison to the previous weeks. If there no , tell the user that kPa increase is normal.\nIf there is rapid increase recently, check if the crop stag is near full fruit growth or harvesting. In the later stages , crop transpiration is very high , thus there is a rapid increase in soil moisture Kpa meaning decrease in moisture in the soil. Also, the moisture drop can be due to high evaporation recently. Check if there is temperature increase meaning high evaporation recently.\nIf the above two are not the cases, ask user to check the moisture physically near the sensor. If the actual moisture is wet near the sensor and the sensor is showing dry, the sensor might be worn out. In this case , ask if the user wants to raise a ticket with the support team."

            "Q: The moisture (kpa) is increasing slowly recently.\nA: Need to check for current stage and evapotranspiration rate. If the crop is recently sown or pruning (छंटाई)  is done recently, the transpiration will be slow and moisture kpa will increase slowly. If evaporation is slow or temperature have dropped on rainfall has happened, it will increase slowly. The chatbot needs to check the temperature , rainfall and crop stage data. And advise if there is any reason for the slow increase.\nIf still there is some confusion, the chatbot needs to ask user to check moisture around the sensor by digging and then ask  the user if he wants to create an issue ticket for the same.",
            "Q: How to measure/ calculate irrigation hours /water tank of my plot in fyllo app? How do I calculate irrigation hours for my plot? How to use the irrigation hours calculator?\nA: To calculate irrigation hours in the Fyllo app, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the Fyllo App\n2. Go to the home screen\n3. Click on the soil moisture-1 sensor\n4. Scroll down to find the \"Irrigation hours\" section\n5. Fill in the required details such as:\n   - Root width (inches)\n   - Root depth (inches)\n   - Soil retention (mm)\n   - Dripper distance (feet)\n   - Dripper discharge (liters)\n6. Click the calculate button\n\nWould you like me to calculate the irrigation hours for you right now? I can retrieve your plot's irrigation settings and perform the calculation if you say yes.\n\nTool Selection: When user says yes, I should:\n1. Use get_irrigation_installation_settings tool to retrieve plot settings\n2. Check if all values are present and valid\n3. If values are valid, use calculate_irrigation_hours tool with these values\n4. If values are missing or invalid, ask the user to provide the missing values\n5. After calculating irrigation hours, display the irrigation installation settings that were used for the calculation\n6. Ask the user if they want to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values, and if yes, prompt them to provide those values\n\nExample response if values are missing:\n\"I checked your plot settings, but I need some additional information to calculate irrigation hours accurately. Could you please provide the [missing value(s)]? Once you provide these details, I can complete the calculation for you.\"\n\nExample response after calculation:\n\"Based on your plot's irrigation settings, the calculated irrigation hours are [X] hours. \n\nI used the following settings for this calculation:\n- Root width: [value] inches\n- Root depth: [value] inches\n- Soil retention: [value] mm\n- Dripper distance: [value] feet\n- Dripper discharge: [value] liters\n\nWould you like to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values?

            "Q: How to measure/ calculate irrigation hours /water tank of my plot in fyllo app? How do I calculate irrigation hours for my plot? How to use the irrigation hours calculator?\nA: To calculate irrigation hours in the Fyllo app, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the Fyllo App\n2. Go to the home screen\n3. Click on the soil moisture-1 sensor\n4. Scroll down to find the \"Irrigation hours\" section\n5. Fill in the required details such as:\n   - Root width (inches)\n   - Root depth (inches)\n   - Soil retention (mm)\n   - Dripper distance (feet)\n   - Dripper discharge (liters)\n6. Click the calculate button\n\nWould you like me to calculate the irrigation hours for you right now? I can retrieve your plot's irrigation settings and perform the calculation if you say yes.\n\nTool Selection: When user says yes, I should:\n1. Use get_irrigation_installation_settings tool to retrieve plot settings\n2. Check if all values are present and valid\n3. If values are valid, use calculate_irrigation_hours tool with these values\n4. If values are missing or invalid, ask the user to provide the missing values\n5. After calculating irrigation hours, display the irrigation installation settings that were used for the calculation\n6. Ask the user if they want to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values, and if yes, prompt them to provide those values\n\nExample response if values are missing:\n\"I checked your plot settings, but I need some additional information to calculate irrigation hours accurately. Could you please provide the [missing value(s)]? Once you provide these details, I can complete the calculation for you.\"\n\nExample response after calculation:\n\"Based on your plot's irrigation settings, the calculated irrigation hours are [X] hours. \n\nI used the following settings for this calculation:\n- Root width: [value] inches\n- Root depth: [value] inches\n- Soil retention: [value] mm\n- Dripper distance: [value] feet\n- Dripper discharge: [value] liters\n\nWould you like to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values? If yes, please provide the new values you'd like to use.\""

            "Q: How to measure/ calculate irrigation hours /water tank of my plot in fyllo app? How do I calculate irrigation hours for my plot? How to use the irrigation hours calculator?\nA: To calculate irrigation hours in the Fyllo app, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the Fyllo App\n2. Go to the home screen\n3. Click on the soil moisture-1 sensor\n4. Scroll down to find the \"Irrigation hours\" section\n5. Fill in the required details such as:\n   - Root width (inches)\n   - Root depth (inches)\n   - Soil retention (mm)\n   - Dripper distance (feet)\n   - Dripper discharge (liters)\n6. Click the calculate button\n\nWould you like me to calculate the irrigation hours for you right now? I can retrieve your plot's irrigation settings and perform the calculation if you say yes.\n\nTool Selection: When user says yes, I should:\n1. Use get_irrigation_installation_settings tool to retrieve plot settings\n2. Check if all values are present and valid\n3. If values are valid, use calculate_irrigation_hours tool with these values\n4. If values are missing or invalid, ask the user to provide the missing values\n5. After calculating irrigation hours, display the irrigation installation settings that were used for the calculation\n6. Ask the user if they want to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values, and if yes, prompt them to provide those values\n\nExample response if values are missing:\n\"I checked your plot settings, but I need some additional information to calculate irrigation hours accurately. Could you please provide the [missing value(s)]? Once you provide these details, I can complete the calculation for you.\"\n\nExample response after calculation:\n\"Based on your plot's irrigation settings, the calculated irrigation hours are [X] hours. \n\nI used the following settings for this calculation:\n- Root width: [value] inches\n- Root depth: [value] inches\n- Soil retention: [value] mm\n- Dripper distance: [value] feet\n- Dripper discharge: [value] liters\n\nWould you like to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values? If yes, please provide the new values you'd like to use.\""

The chatbot needs to :\nCheck the actual kpa increase rate if it's higher now  in comparison to the previous weeks. If there no , tell the user that kPa increase is normal.\nIf there is rapid increase recently, check if the crop stag is near full fruit growth or harvesting. In the later stages , crop transpiration is very high , thus there is a rapid increase in soil moisture Kpa meaning decrease in moisture in the soil. Also, the moisture drop can be due to high evaporation recently. Check if there is temperature increase meaning high evaporation recently.\nIf the above two are not the cases, ask user to check the moisture physically near the sensor.

If evaporation is slow or temperature have dropped on rainfall has happened, it will increase slowly. The chatbot needs to check the temperature , rainfall and crop stage data. And advise if there is any reason for the slow increase.\nIf still there is some confusion, the chatbot needs to ask user to check moisture around the sensor by digging and then ask  the user if he wants to create an issue ticket for the same."

The chatbot needs to :\nCheck the actual kpa increase rate if it's higher now  in comparison to the previous weeks. If there no , tell the user that kPa increase is normal.\nIf there is rapid increase recently, check if the crop stag is near full fruit growth or harvesting. In the later stages , crop transpiration is very high , thus there is a rapid increase in soil moisture Kpa meaning decrease in moisture in the soil. Also, the moisture drop can be due to high evaporation recently. Check if there is temperature increase meaning high evaporation recently.\nIf the above two are not the cases, ask user to check the moisture physically near the sensor. If the actual moisture is wet near the sensor and the sensor is showing dry, the sensor might be worn out. In this case , ask if the user wants to raise a ticket with the support team."

            "Q: How do I know if my soil  moisture sensor is working fine ?\nA: The only way to know is if after irrigation the sensor is dropping below 5 kpa and increasing continuously unless next irrigation is done. You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault. If the soil moisture sensor reading is consistently at 0 from few 48 hours, then it could be anamolous (use live and historical hourly soil moisture data (use tool) to validate).",
            "Q: How to calibrate soil moisture sensors ?\nA:  The way to calibrate sensors is by putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. A drop after watering or irrigation and continuous dry upto 200 kpa means that the sensor is calibrated.",
            "Q: What should I do if the soil moisture sensor values fluctuate?\nA: Ensure the sensor is installed properly in the soil, check for air bubbles, and contact Fyllo representative if the issue persists.",
            "Q: Sensor is showing wet, i.e. less kpa but soil looks dry.\nA: The sensor measures the moisture around the rootzone which is not visible from the top. Ask use to check the moisture in rootzone around the sensor. If it matches, ask the user to irrigate.",
            "Q: Sensor is showing dry, but it rained recently.\nA: Rainwater doesn't percolate well in the soil. Most of it runs off. After a day of rain stops , if the sensor is still dry, you will have to irrigate. You can check the moisture by digging near the sensor . Irrigate accordingly."

            "Q: The moisture (kpa) is increasing slowly recently.\nA: Need to check for current stage and evapotranspiration rate. If the crop is recently sown or pruning (छंटाई)  is done recently, the transpiration will be slow and moisture kpa will increase slowly. If evaporation is slow or temperature have dropped on rainfall has happened, it will increase slowly. The chatbot needs to check the temperature , rainfall and crop stage data. And advise if there is any reason for the slow increase.\nIf still there is some confusion, the chatbot needs to ask user to check moisture around the sensor by digging and then ask  the user if he wants to create an issue ticket for the same.",
            "Q: How to measure/ calculate irrigation hours /water tank of my plot in fyllo app? How do I calculate irrigation hours for my plot? How to use the irrigation hours calculator?\nA: To calculate irrigation hours in the Fyllo app, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the Fyllo App\n2. Go to the home screen\n3. Click on the soil moisture-1 sensor\n4. Scroll down to find the \"Irrigation hours\" section\n5. Fill in the required details such as:\n   - Root width (inches)\n   - Root depth (inches)\n   - Soil retention (mm)\n   - Dripper distance (feet)\n   - Dripper discharge (liters)\n6. Click the calculate button\n\nWould you like me to calculate the irrigation hours for you right now? I can retrieve your plot's irrigation settings and perform the calculation if you say yes.\n\nTool Selection: When user says yes, I should:\n1. Use get_irrigation_installation_settings tool to retrieve plot settings\n2. Check if all values are present and valid\n3. If values are valid, use calculate_irrigation_hours tool with these values\n4. If values are missing or invalid, ask the user to provide the missing values\n5. After calculating irrigation hours, display the irrigation installation settings that were used for the calculation\n6. Ask the user if they want to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values, and if yes, prompt them to provide those values\n\nExample response if values are missing:\n\"I checked your plot settings, but I need some additional information to calculate irrigation hours accurately. Could you please provide the [missing value(s)]? Once you provide these details, I can complete the calculation for you.\"\n\nExample response after calculation:\n\"Based on your plot's irrigation settings, the calculated irrigation hours are [X] hours. \n\nI used the following settings for this calculation:\n- Root width: [value] inches\n- Root depth: [value] inches\n- Soil retention: [value] mm\n- Dripper distance: [value] feet\n- Dripper discharge: [value] liters\n\nWould you like to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values?

            "Q: How to measure/ calculate irrigation hours /water tank of my plot in fyllo app? How do I calculate irrigation hours for my plot? How to use the irrigation hours calculator?\nA: To calculate irrigation hours in the Fyllo app, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the Fyllo App\n2. Go to the home screen\n3. Click on the soil moisture-1 sensor\n4. Scroll down to find the \"Irrigation hours\" section\n5. Fill in the required details such as:\n   - Root width (inches)\n   - Root depth (inches)\n   - Soil retention (mm)\n   - Dripper distance (feet)\n   - Dripper discharge (liters)\n6. Click the calculate button\n\nWould you like me to calculate the irrigation hours for you right now? I can retrieve your plot's irrigation settings and perform the calculation if you say yes.\n\nTool Selection: When user says yes, I should:\n1. Use get_irrigation_installation_settings tool to retrieve plot settings\n2. Check if all values are present and valid\n3. If values are valid, use calculate_irrigation_hours tool with these values\n4. If values are missing or invalid, ask the user to provide the missing values\n5. After calculating irrigation hours, display the irrigation installation settings that were used for the calculation\n6. Ask the user if they want to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values, and if yes, prompt them to provide those values\n\nExample response if values are missing:\n\"I checked your plot settings, but I need some additional information to calculate irrigation hours accurately. Could you please provide the [missing value(s)]? Once you provide these details, I can complete the calculation for you.\"\n\nExample response after calculation:\n\"Based on your plot's irrigation settings, the calculated irrigation hours are [X] hours. \n\nI used the following settings for this calculation:\n- Root width: [value] inches\n- Root depth: [value] inches\n- Soil retention: [value] mm\n- Dripper distance: [value] feet\n- Dripper discharge: [value] liters\n\nWould you like to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values? If yes, please provide the new values you'd like to use.\""

            "Q: How to measure/ calculate irrigation hours /water tank of my plot in fyllo app? How do I calculate irrigation hours for my plot? How to use the irrigation hours calculator?\nA: To calculate irrigation hours in the Fyllo app, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the Fyllo App\n2. Go to the home screen\n3. Click on the soil moisture-1 sensor\n4. Scroll down to find the \"Irrigation hours\" section\n5. Fill in the required details such as:\n   - Root width (inches)\n   - Root depth (inches)\n   - Soil retention (mm)\n   - Dripper distance (feet)\n   - Dripper discharge (liters)\n6. Click the calculate button\n\nWould you like me to calculate the irrigation hours for you right now? I can retrieve your plot's irrigation settings and perform the calculation if you say yes.\n\nTool Selection: When user says yes, I should:\n1. Use get_irrigation_installation_settings tool to retrieve plot settings\n2. Check if all values are present and valid\n3. If values are valid, use calculate_irrigation_hours tool with these values\n4. If values are missing or invalid, ask the user to provide the missing values\n5. After calculating irrigation hours, display the irrigation installation settings that were used for the calculation\n6. Ask the user if they want to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values, and if yes, prompt them to provide those values\n\nExample response if values are missing:\n\"I checked your plot settings, but I need some additional information to calculate irrigation hours accurately. Could you please provide the [missing value(s)]? Once you provide these details, I can complete the calculation for you.\"\n\nExample response after calculation:\n\"Based on your plot's irrigation settings, the calculated irrigation hours are [X] hours. \n\nI used the following settings for this calculation:\n- Root width: [value] inches\n- Root depth: [value] inches\n- Soil retention: [value] mm\n- Dripper distance: [value] feet\n- Dripper discharge: [value] liters\n\nWould you like to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values? If yes, please provide the new values you'd like to use.\""

            "Q: How to measure/ calculate irrigation hours /water tank of my plot in fyllo app? How do I calculate irrigation hours for my plot? How to use the irrigation hours calculator?\nA: To calculate irrigation hours in the Fyllo app, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the Fyllo App\n2. Go to the home screen\n3. Click on the soil moisture-1 sensor\n4. Scroll down to find the \"Irrigation hours\" section\n5. Fill in the required details such as:\n   - Root width (inches)\n   - Root depth (inches)\n   - Soil retention (mm)\n   - Dripper distance (feet)\n   - Dripper discharge (liters)\n6. Click the calculate button\n\nWould you like me to calculate the irrigation hours for you right now? I can retrieve your plot's irrigation settings and perform the calculation if you say yes.\n\nTool Selection: When user says yes, I should:\n1. Use get_irrigation_installation_settings tool to retrieve plot settings\n2. Check if all values are present and valid\n3. If values are valid, use calculate_irrigation_hours tool with these values\n4. If values are missing or invalid, ask the user to provide the missing values\n5. After calculating irrigation hours, display the irrigation installation settings that were used for the calculation\n6. Ask the user if they want to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values, and if yes, prompt them to provide those values\n\nExample response if values are missing:\n\"I checked your plot settings, but I need some additional information to calculate irrigation hours accurately. Could you please provide the [missing value(s)]? Once you provide these details, I can complete the calculation for you.\"\n\nExample response after calculation:\n\"Based on your plot's irrigation settings, the calculated irrigation hours are [X] hours. \n\nI used the following settings for this calculation:\n- Root width: [value] inches\n- Root depth: [value] inches\n- Soil retention: [value] mm\n- Dripper distance: [value] feet\n- Dripper discharge: [value] liters\n\nWould you like to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values? If yes, please provide the new values you'd like to use.\""

            "Q: How do I know if my soil  moisture sensor is working fine ?\nA: The only way to know is if after irrigation the sensor is dropping below 5 kpa and increasing continuously unless next irrigation is done. You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault. If the soil moisture sensor reading is consistently at 0 from few 48 hours, then it could be anamolous (use live and historical hourly soil moisture data (use tool) to validate).",
            "Q: How to calibrate soil moisture sensors ?\nA:  The way to calibrate sensors is by putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. A drop after watering or irrigation and continuous dry upto 200 kpa means that the sensor is calibrated.",
            "Q: What should I do if the soil moisture sensor values fluctuate?\nA: Ensure the sensor is installed properly in the soil, check for air bubbles, and contact Fyllo representative if the issue persists.",
            "Q: Sensor is showing wet, i.e. less kpa but soil looks dry.\nA: The sensor measures the moisture around the rootzone which is not visible from the top. Ask use to check the moisture in rootzone around the sensor. If it matches, ask the user to irrigate.",
            "Q: Sensor is showing dry, but it rained recently.\nA: Rainwater doesn't percolate well in the soil. Most of it runs off. After a day of rain stops , if the sensor is still dry, you will have to irrigate. You can check the moisture by digging near the sensor . Irrigate accordingly."

You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault. If the soil moisture sensor reading is consistently at 0 from few 48 hours, then it could be anamolous (use live and historical hourly soil moisture data (use tool) to validate).",

            "Q: How to measure/ calculate irrigation hours /water tank of my plot in fyllo app? How do I calculate irrigation hours for my plot? How to use the irrigation hours calculator?\nA: To calculate irrigation hours in the Fyllo app, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the Fyllo App\n2. Go to the home screen\n3. Click on the soil moisture-1 sensor\n4. Scroll down to find the \"Irrigation hours\" section\n5. Fill in the required details such as:\n   - Root width (inches)\n   - Root depth (inches)\n   - Soil retention (mm)\n   - Dripper distance (feet)\n   - Dripper discharge (liters)\n6. Click the calculate button\n\nWould you like me to calculate the irrigation hours for you right now? I can retrieve your plot's irrigation settings and perform the calculation if you say yes.\n\nTool Selection: When user says yes, I should:\n1. Use get_irrigation_installation_settings tool to retrieve plot settings\n2. Check if all values are present and valid\n3. If values are valid, use calculate_irrigation_hours tool with these values\n4. If values are missing or invalid, ask the user to provide the missing values\n5. After calculating irrigation hours, display the irrigation installation settings that were used for the calculation\n6. Ask the user if they want to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values, and if yes, prompt them to provide those values\n\nExample response if values are missing:\n\"I checked your plot settings, but I need some additional information to calculate irrigation hours accurately. Could you please provide the [missing value(s)]? Once you provide these details, I can complete the calculation for you.\"\n\nExample response after calculation:\n\"Based on your plot's irrigation settings, the calculated irrigation hours are [X] hours. \n\nI used the following settings for this calculation:\n- Root width: [value] inches\n- Root depth: [value] inches\n- Soil retention: [value] mm\n- Dripper distance: [value] feet\n- Dripper discharge: [value] liters\n\nWould you like to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values? If yes, please provide the new values you'd like to use.\""

            "Q: How to measure/ calculate irrigation hours /water tank of my plot in fyllo app? How do I calculate irrigation hours for my plot? How to use the irrigation hours calculator?\nA: To calculate irrigation hours in the Fyllo app, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the Fyllo App\n2. Go to the home screen\n3. Click on the soil moisture-1 sensor\n4. Scroll down to find the \"Irrigation hours\" section\n5. Fill in the required details such as:\n   - Root width (inches)\n   - Root depth (inches)\n   - Soil retention (mm)\n   - Dripper distance (feet)\n   - Dripper discharge (liters)\n6. Click the calculate button\n\nWould you like me to calculate the irrigation hours for you right now? I can retrieve your plot's irrigation settings and perform the calculation if you say yes.\n\nTool Selection: When user says yes, I should:\n1. Use get_irrigation_installation_settings tool to retrieve plot settings\n2. Check if all values are present and valid\n3. If values are valid, use calculate_irrigation_hours tool with these values\n4. If values are missing or invalid, ask the user to provide the missing values\n5. After calculating irrigation hours, display the irrigation installation settings that were used for the calculation\n6. Ask the user if they want to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values, and if yes, prompt them to provide those values\n\nExample response if values are missing:\n\"I checked your plot settings, but I need some additional information to calculate irrigation hours accurately. Could you please provide the [missing value(s)]? Once you provide these details, I can complete the calculation for you.\"\n\nExample response after calculation:\n\"Based on your plot's irrigation settings, the calculated irrigation hours are [X] hours. \n\nI used the following settings for this calculation:\n- Root width: [value] inches\n- Root depth: [value] inches\n- Soil retention: [value] mm\n- Dripper distance: [value] feet\n- Dripper discharge: [value] liters\n\nWould you like to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values? If yes, please provide the new values you'd like to use.\""
