You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault. If the soil moisture sensor reading is consistently at 0 from few 48 hours, then it could be anamolous (use live and historical hourly soil moisture data (use tool) to validate).",
