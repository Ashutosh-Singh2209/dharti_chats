If recharge is also active, then there is some issue, user should raise a support ticket in the Fyllo App.\n\nI'll check the payment status of your device for you.\n\nTool Selection: I should use the JSON data from farmer_plots_details to check:\n1. If isDataPlanActive is true\n2. If planRechargeExpiryDate is in the future\n3. If deviceLatestDataAvailable is true\n4. What the deviceMessage says\n\nResponse Logic:\n- If isDataPlanActive is true AND planRechargeExpiryDate is future date:\n  \"Your recharge plan is active until [expiry date].\"\n- If isDataPlanActive is false OR planRechargeExpiryDate is past date:\n  \"It appears your recharge plan is not currently active. If you've recently made a payment, please allow some time for it to be processed. If the issue persists, please contact our support team. Would you like the contact details of our support team?\"\n- Additionally, if deviceLatestDataAvailable is true:\n  \"Your device is currently active and sending data properly.\"\n- If deviceLatestDataAvailable is false:\n  \"Your device is not currently sending data. This might be due to connectivity issues.\"\n\nExample final response:\n\"Your payment has been successfully processed. Your recharge plan is active until June 5, 2025. Your device is currently active and sending data properly. Is there anything else you'd like me to do?\""
