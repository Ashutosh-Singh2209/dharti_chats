            "Q: How do I know if my soil  moisture sensor is working fine ?\nA: The only way to know is if after irrigation the sensor is dropping below 5 kpa and increasing continuously unless next irrigation is done. You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault. If the soil moisture sensor reading is consistently at 0 from few 48 hours, then it could be anamolous (use live and historical hourly soil moisture data (use tool) to validate).",

A drop after watering or irrigation and continuous dry upto 200 kpa means that the sensor is calibrated."

If this is the case, ask them to do atleast 3 irrigations as per their previous schedule without sensors and sensors would b set by then.\nIf the crop stage is very early or pruing is done recently, the water takeup by plants is negligible in this period because of very less transpiration.

        "en": "A fogger is a device used in agriculture to apply pesticides, fungicides, or fertilizers in the form of a fine mist or fog. This method allows for even distribution of the chemicals over crops, ensuring better coverage and absorption. \n\n### Benefits of Using a Fogger:\n1. **Uniform Application**: Ensures that the chemicals reach all parts of the plant, including the undersides of leaves.\n2. **Reduced Chemical Use**: The fine mist can reduce the amount of chemical needed compared to traditional spraying methods.\n3. **Less Drift**: Foggers minimize drift, which can occur with conventional sprayers, reducing the risk of affecting non-target areas.\n4. **Effective for Pest Control**: Fogging can be particularly effective for controlling pests and diseases in dense crops.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Timing**: Use foggers during early morning or late evening when temperatures are cooler and wind speeds are lower to minimize drift.\n- **Safety**: Always wear protective gear when handling chemicals and ensure that the area is clear of people and animals during application.\n\nIf you need specific recommendations for using a fogger on your cucumber plots or have any other questions, feel free to ask!",
