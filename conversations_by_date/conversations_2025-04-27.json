You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault.

If there no , tell the user that kPa increase is normal.\nIf there is rapid increase recently, check if the crop stag is near full fruit growth or harvesting.

Also, the moisture drop can be due to high evaporation recently. Check if there is temperature increase meaning high evaporation recently.\nIf the above two are not the cases, ask user to check the moisture physically near the sensor.

If evaporation is slow or temperature have dropped on rainfall has happened, it will increase slowly. The chatbot needs to check the temperature , rainfall and crop stage data.
