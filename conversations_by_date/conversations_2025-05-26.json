        "en": "According to the stain analysis on the page, specific spray advice is not available. However, I suggest some general measures to manage the health of your crop:\n\n1. **Nutrition Management**: Make sure crops are getting adequate nutrition, especially nitrogen, which can increase leaf greening.\n   \n2. **Fungalide Application**: If fungal infection is suspected, consider using a broad spectrum of fungicide as a preventive measure.\n\n3. **Pest Control**: Check for any signs of insects and use appropriate pesticides if necessary.\n\n4. **Culture Method**: Ensure a good circle of air around crops and avoid the use of overhead water, which will reduce humidity and do not promote fungal diseases.\n\nFor more consistent advice, please provide a clearer picture focusing on the affected areas.",
