The soil texture and the crop rooting depth determine this. A deeper rooting depth means there is a larger volume of water stored in the soil and therefore a larger reservoir of water for the crop to draw upon between irrigations. Knowing the soil water storage capacity allows the irrigator to determine how much water to apply at one time and how long to wait between each irrigation. For example, the amount of water applied at one time on a sandy soil, which has a low soil water storage capacity, would be less than for a loam soil, which has a higher soil water storage capacity."

Iron sulfate ko soil mein achhe se milana na bhoolen.\n2. Paani dekar usse activate karne ki koshish karein.\n\nIsse pehle, soil test karna zaroori hai taaki aapko pata chale ki aapke soil ki pH kya hai aur aapko kitna amendment karna hai.

                        "Q: How do I know if my soil  moisture sensor is working fine ?\nA: The only way to know is if after irrigation the sensor is dropping below 5 kpa and increasing continuously unless next irrigation is done. You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault. If the soil moisture sensor reading is consistently at 0 from few 48 hours, then it could be anamolous (use live and historical hourly soil moisture data (use tool) to validate).",
                        "Q: How to calibrate soil moisture sensors ?\nA:  The way to calibrate sensors is by putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. A drop after watering or irrigation and continuous dry upto 200 kpa means that the sensor is calibrated.",
                        "Q: What should I do if the soil moisture sensor always shows wet values?\nA: Verify the irrigation frequency, check the installation point, and contact Fyllo representative if the issue persists.",
                        "Q: What should I do if the soil moisture sensor values fluctuate?\nA: Ensure the sensor is installed properly in the soil, check for air bubbles, and contact Fyllo representative if the issue persists.",
                        "Q: How can the sensor monitor the whole plot when it's installed near one plant?\nA: The installation process includes a detailed survey of the plot regarding variations in soil type and root zone. A point for installation is selected with a plant of average growth representing the whole plot."

Isse aapko soil ki pH, nutrient levels, aur moisture content ka pata chalega.\n\n2. **Moisture Sensors**: \n   - Agar aapke paas soil moisture sensors hain, to unka data regularly check karein. Yeh aapko batayega ki soil kitna wet ya dry hai.\n\n3. **Crop Health Monitoring**: \n   - Plants ki health ko observe karein. Agar leaves yellow ho rahe hain ya growth slow hai, to ye kisi nutrient deficiency ya disease ka sanket ho sakta hai.\n\n4. **Weather Monitoring**: \n   - Local weather conditions ko track karein. Isse aap irrigation aur pest control ke liye sahi samay ka pata kar sakte hain.\n\n5. **Irrigation Schedule**: \n   - Irrigation ka schedule maintain karein aur soil moisture data ke adhar par watering karein.\n\n6. **Pest and Disease Monitoring**: \n   - Regularly pest aur disease ke liye plants ko check karein. Agar koi symptoms dikhai dete hain, to turant action lein.\n\n7. **Record Keeping**: \n   - Har activity ka record rakhein, jaise ki irrigation dates, fertilizer application, aur pest control measures. Isse aapko future mein decision lene mein madad milegi.\n\nIn steps ko follow karke aap apne khet ki regular monitoring kar sakte hain aur crops ki health ko maintain kar sakte hain.",

This stage is crucial for the development of the plant.\n\n2. **Soil Moisture**: \n   - The soil moisture is at **11 kPa**, indicating that the soil is adequately moist. This is a good level for the vegetative growth stage.\n\n3. **Evapotranspiration Data**: \n   - There is no recorded evapotranspiration data for the period from **December 1 to December 19, 2024**. This could indicate a lack of data collection or environmental factors affecting transpiration.\n\n4. **Sensor Readings**: \n   - The soil temperature is **24.87°C**, and the battery level of the device is at **78%**, which is acceptable.\n\n### Possible Issues:\n- **Slow Increase in Soil Moisture**: If you are noticing that the soil moisture is increasing slowly, it could be due to:\n  - The current crop stage (vegetative growth) where transpiration may be slower.\n  - Lack of evapotranspiration data, which could help understand moisture loss.\n  - Environmental factors such as lower temperatures or recent rainfall.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Check Soil Moisture Manually**: Consider digging around the sensor area to verify the moisture levels.\n- **Monitor Weather Conditions**: Keep an eye on temperature and rainfall, as these can affect moisture levels.\n- **Raise a Support Ticket**: If you continue to experience issues or have concerns about the sensor data, consider raising a support ticket in the Fyllo app.\n\nIf you need further assistance or specific actions, please let me know!",

                        "Q: Does Fyllo provide a fertigation schedule?\nA: Yes, Fyllo provides a fertigation schedule for users.",
                        "Q: Where can I find the fertigation schedule in the Fyllo app?\nA: To access the fertigation schedule:\n    1. Open the Fyllo app\n    2. Select \"My Farm\" at the bottom\n    3. Tap on the \"Fertigation\" option\n   You'll find the fertigation schedule there, including details about the required fertilizer applications.",
                        "Q: If I don't add any test data, what is the basis for the generated fertigation schedule?\nA: When no specific test data is provided, Fyllo generates a basic fertigation schedule based on:\n\n    1. Typical nutrient needs for your crop type\n    2. General soil characteristics common in your region\n    3. Standard growing practices for your area\n    This schedule provides a starting point, but may not be as precise as one based on specific test data.",
                        "Q: Can I generate a fertigation schedule without soil, leaf, or petiole data?\nA: Yes, you can generate a basic fertigation schedule without specific soil, leaf, or petiole data. Fyllo will create a general schedule based on typical crop needs and soil types for your region.",
                        "Q: Do I need to do fertigation on my farm?\nA: Fyllo provides a fixed fertigation schedule based on plot and crop details, along with weather forecasting data for farmer plots, to decide the fertilizer/fertigation needs."

                        "Q: I irrigated still the sensor is showing dry.\nA: Ask user when he irrigated. It usually takes 12 hours to reach the water till sensor. If the sensor is not dropping even after 12 hours, it can be due to one of the following reasons :\nWater is not reaching properly till the sensor , this can be due to drip blocked , or slope in the land or dripper outlets far away from the sensor. Ask user to check if drip is fine and  dripper is within the range of sensor. \nThe sensor can be very old , more than two years , in this case , the sensor might be malfunction, ask user if he wants to raise a ticket",
                        "Q: I irrigated still the sensor is dropping slowly.\nA: Sometimes, the water reaches slowly till root zone and the moisture sensor kPa value drops slowly. Always wait for 12 hours after irrigation for the moisture to saturate. If still some confusion, ask user to check moisture near the sensor and check if he wants to raise a ticket for the issue.",
                        "Q: How to calibrate soil moisture sensors ?\nA:  The way to calibrate sensors is by putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. A drop after watering or irrigation and continuous dry upto 200 kpa means that the sensor is calibrated.",
                        "Q: What should I do if the soil moisture sensor always shows wet values?\nA: Verify the irrigation frequency, check the installation point, and contact Fyllo representative if the issue persists.",
                        "Q: In the latest irrigation , sensor didn't drop to 0.\nA: 0 to 5 Kpa means soil is fully wet. It need not drop to 0 every time. Moisture less than 5 also means wet conditions. So, need not worry. Also ask to wait for 12 hours after irrigation."

                        "Q: How can the sensor monitor the whole plot when it's installed near one plant?\nA: The installation process includes a detailed survey of the plot regarding variations in soil type and root zone. A point for installation is selected with a plant of average growth representing the whole plot.",
                        "Q: Sensor is showing wet, i.e. less kpa but soil looks dry.\nA: The sensor measures the moisture around the rootzone which is not visible from the top. Ask use to check the moisture in rootzone around the sensor. If it matches, ask the user to irrigate.",
                        "Q: How do I know if my soil  moisture sensor is working fine ?\nA: The only way to know is if after irrigation the sensor is dropping below 5 kpa and increasing continuously unless next irrigation is done. You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault. If the soil moisture sensor reading is consistently at 0 from few 48 hours, then it could be anamolous (use live and historical hourly soil moisture data (use tool) to validate).",
                        "Q: I irrigated still the sensor is dropping slowly.\nA: Sometimes, the water reaches slowly till root zone and the moisture sensor kPa value drops slowly. Always wait for 12 hours after irrigation for the moisture to saturate. If still some confusion, ask user to check moisture near the sensor and check if he wants to raise a ticket for the issue.",
                        "Q: Sensor is showing dry, but it rained recently.\nA: Rainwater doesn't percolate well in the soil. Most of it runs off. After a day of rain stops , if the sensor is still dry, you will have to irrigate. You can check the moisture by digging near the sensor . Irrigate accordingly."

                        "Q: If I don't add any test data, what is the basis for the generated fertigation schedule?\nA: When no specific test data is provided, Fyllo generates a basic fertigation schedule based on:\n\n    1. Typical nutrient needs for your crop type\n    2. General soil characteristics common in your region\n    3. Standard growing practices for your area\n    This schedule provides a starting point, but may not be as precise as one based on specific test data.",

You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault. If the soil moisture sensor reading is consistently at 0 from few 48 hours, then it could be anamolous (use live and historical hourly soil moisture data (use tool) to validate).",

It can be due to following :\nIf the device is recently installed, there can be moisture  around the sensor because the sensor is dipped in the water before installing. If this is the case, ask them to do atleast 3 irrigations as per their previous schedule without sensors and sensors would b set by then.\nIf the crop stage is very early or pruing is done recently, the water takeup by plants is negligible in this period because of very less transpiration. If this is the case, ask them to wait till irrigation Kpa in the present stage.\nSometimes, the water can remain accumulated around the sensor due to local landscaping or slope in the land around sensor. In this case, please check the around the sensor. It will have to be reinstalled properly. Chatbot should ask the user if he wants to create an issue ticket for the same"

If the soil is less nutritious or doesn't have the right moisture, the return of the drink can be reduced.\n\n3. **Crop stage**: The growth and development stage of crops also influence the return of the crop.

Spray every two weeks from bud break until fruit coloring begins.\n\n### 2. **Grape Rust**\n- **Symptoms**: \n  - Orange-brown powdery masses on the underside of leaves.\n  - Premature leaf drop.\n- **Treatment**: \n  - Use fungicides like Bordeaux mixture, difolatan, propiconazole, tebuconazole, or azoxystrobin.\n  - Apply 3-4 sprays of Baycor (0.1%) at fortnight intervals during the growing season.\n\n### 3. **Downy Mildew of Grape**\n- **Symptoms**: \n  - Yellowish-green oily spots with a brownish halo on leaves.\n  - Irregular brown patches.\n  - White to grayish cottony coat under the spots.\n  - Can affect shoots, tendrils, and inflorescence.\n  - Stunted growth.\n- **Treatment**: \n  - Use protectant fungicides, ensuring proper application to the underside of leaves.\n  - Copper-based fungicides like Bordeaux mixture and dithiocarbamates are recommended.\n  - Post-infection fungicides should be applied immediately after symptoms appear.\n\n### Notes\nIt's crucial to follow good cultural practices and monitor your crop regularly to manage these diseases effectively.",

You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault. If the soil moisture sensor reading is consistently at 0 from few 48 hours, then it could be anamolous (use live and historical hourly soil moisture data (use tool) to validate)."

Benefits include:\n\n    1. More accurate nutrient recommendations\n    2. Better alignment with your crop's actual needs\n    3. Potential for improved crop health and yield\n    4. More efficient use of fertilizers\n    5. Possible reduction in fertilizer costs and environmental impact",

When creating a new report: Go to \"Fertigation,\" then \"Create Report,\" and input the details from your test results.\n    2. Upload copies: You can directly upload photocopies or scans of your test reports in the app. Look for an \"Upload Reports\" or similar option in the Fertigation section."

Fertilizers are given by 3 distribution methods:  \n- Fertigation: fertilizers put into the irrigation pipeline itself  \n- Foliar: on the leaves using a foliar spray  \n- Soil: directly on the soil  \nIf the unit of fertilizer amount includes \"per acre\", then it is for 1 acre.

                        "Q: What should I do if I can't find the fertigation schedule after selecting the fertigation tab?\nA: If you don't see the fertigation schedule, you'll need to create a report first. Would you like assistance in creating a report? Do you have any soil, leaf, or petiole test data available? If not, we can generate a basic schedule for you using general crop and regional data.",
                        "Q: What are the advantages of adding soil, leaf, or petiole test reports?\nA: By adding test reports, Fyllo can generate a more precise fertigation schedule tailored to your specific conditions. Benefits include:\n\n    1. More accurate nutrient recommendations\n    2. Better alignment with your crop's actual needs\n    3. Potential for improved crop health and yield\n    4. More efficient use of fertilizers\n    5. Possible reduction in fertilizer costs and environmental impact",
                        "Q: Why should I consider soil, leaf, or petiole testing?\nA: Soil, leaf, and petiole testing are crucial for effective plant health management. These tests provide specific data about your crop's nutrient needs, allowing for more precise fertilizer application. This can lead to higher productivity with optimized input use, potentially reducing costs and environmental impact.",
                        "Q: Can I generate a fertigation schedule without soil, leaf, or petiole data?\nA: Yes, you can generate a basic fertigation schedule without specific soil, leaf, or petiole data. Fyllo will create a general schedule based on typical crop needs and soil types for your region.",
                        "Q: Where can I add soil, leaf, or petiole test reports in the app?\nA: You can add test reports in two ways:\n\n    1. When creating a new report: Go to \"Fertigation,\" then \"Create Report,\" and input the details from your test results.\n    2. Upload copies: You can directly upload photocopies or scans of your test reports in the app. Look for an \"Upload Reports\" or similar option in the Fertigation section."

If there no , tell the user that kPa increase is normal.\nIf there is rapid increase recently, check if the crop stag is near full fruit growth or harvesting.

You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault. If the soil moisture sensor reading is consistently at 0 from few 48 hours, then it could be anamolous (use live and historical hourly soil moisture data (use tool) to validate).",

You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault. If the soil moisture sensor reading is consistently at 0 from few 48 hours, then it could be anamolous (use live and historical hourly soil moisture data (use tool) to validate).",

A drop after watering or irrigation and continuous dry upto 200 kpa means that the sensor is calibrated.",

These tests provide specific data about your crop's nutrient needs, allowing for more precise fertilizer application. This can lead to higher productivity with optimized input use, potentially reducing costs and environmental impact.",

Would you like assistance in creating a report? Do you have any soil, leaf, or petiole test data available? If not, we can generate a basic schedule for you using general crop and regional data."

Is my device sending data? Are my all devices working properly? Is my device online? Is my device connected? What is the status of my device? Is my Fyllo device transmitting data?\nA: If device is sending data proactively, then it is working fine. If user has not recharged the device, then it will not work, and user should do recharge. If recharge is also active, then there is some issue, user should raise a support ticket in the Fyllo App.\n\nI'll check the payment status of your device for you.\n\nTool Selection: I should use the JSON data from farmer_plots_details to check:\n1. If isDataPlanActive is true\n2. If planRechargeExpiryDate is in the future\n3. If deviceLatestDataAvailable is true\n4. What the deviceMessage says\n\nResponse Logic:\n- If isDataPlanActive is true AND planRechargeExpiryDate is future date:\n  \"Your recharge plan is active until [expiry date].\"\n- If isDataPlanActive is false OR planRechargeExpiryDate is past date:\n  \"It appears your recharge plan is not currently active. If you've recently made a payment, please allow some time for it to be processed. If the issue persists, please contact our support team. Would you like the contact details of our support team?\"\n- Additionally, if deviceLatestDataAvailable is true:\n  \"Your device is currently active and sending data properly.\"\n- If deviceLatestDataAvailable is false:\n  \"Your device is not currently sending data. This might be due to connectivity issues.\"\n\nExample final response:\n\"Your payment has been successfully processed. Your recharge plan is active until June 5, 2025. Your device is currently active and sending data properly. Is there anything else you'd like me to do?\""

These tests provide specific data about your crop's nutrient needs, allowing for more precise fertilizer application. This can lead to higher productivity with optimized input use, potentially reducing costs and environmental impact.",
                        "Q: What are the advantages of adding soil, leaf, or petiole test reports?\nA: By adding test reports, Fyllo can generate a more precise fertigation schedule tailored to your specific conditions. Benefits include:\n\n    1. More accurate nutrient recommendations\n    2. Better alignment with your crop's actual needs\n    3. Potential for improved crop health and yield\n    4. More efficient use of fertilizers\n    5. Possible reduction in fertilizer costs and environmental impact",
                        "Q: Where can I add soil, leaf, or petiole test reports in the app?\nA: You can add test reports in two ways:\n\n    1. When creating a new report: Go to \"Fertigation,\" then \"Create Report,\" and input the details from your test results.\n    2. Upload copies: You can directly upload photocopies or scans of your test reports in the app. Look for an \"Upload Reports\" or similar option in the Fertigation section.",
                        "Q: What should I do if the soil moisture sensor values fluctuate?\nA: Ensure the sensor is installed properly in the soil, check for air bubbles, and contact Fyllo representative if the issue persists.",
                        "Q: What should I do if the soil moisture sensor always shows wet values?\nA: Verify the irrigation frequency, check the installation point, and contact Fyllo representative if the issue persists."

Here are some key practices to consider for successful cucumber cultivation in a polyhouse:\n\n1. **Soil Preparation**: Ensure the soil is well-drained and rich in organic matter. A loamy soil mix is ideal.\n\n2. **Seed Selection**: Use high-quality seeds that are suitable for polyhouse cultivation. Consider disease-resistant varieties.\n\n3. **Sowing**: Sow seeds at the right depth and spacing. Typically, seeds should be sown about 1-2 inches deep.\n\n4. **Temperature Control**: Maintain optimal temperatures (around 20-25°C) for germination and growth. Use ventilation and shading as needed.\n\n5. **Irrigation**: Implement a drip irrigation system to provide consistent moisture without waterlogging. Monitor soil moisture levels regularly.\n\n6. **Fertility Management**: Use balanced fertilizers based on soil tests. Fertigation can be an effective method to deliver nutrients.\n\n7. **Pest and Disease Management**: Regularly monitor for pests like aphids and diseases like powdery mildew. Use integrated pest management (IPM) strategies.\n\n8. **Pruning and Training**: Train cucumber vines on trellises to improve air circulation and light penetration.\n\n9. **Harvesting**: Harvest cucumbers when they are young and tender for the best flavor.\n\n10. **Record Keeping**: Maintain records of planting dates, pest occurrences, and harvest yields to improve future crop management.\n\nIf you need specific advice on irrigation, pest control, or fertilization for your cucumber plots, feel free to ask!",

                        "Q: Do I need to do fertigation on my farm?\nA: Fyllo provides a fixed fertigation schedule based on plot and crop details, along with weather forecasting data for farmer plots, to decide the fertilizer/fertigation needs.",

                        "Q: What should I do if I can't find the fertigation schedule after selecting the fertigation tab?\nA: If you don't see the fertigation schedule, you'll need to create a report first. Would you like assistance in creating a report? Do you have any soil, leaf, or petiole test data available? If not, we can generate a basic schedule for you using general crop and regional data.",
                        "Q: Can I generate a fertigation schedule without soil, leaf, or petiole data?\nA: Yes, you can generate a basic fertigation schedule without specific soil, leaf, or petiole data. Fyllo will create a general schedule based on typical crop needs and soil types for your region.",
                        "Q: How do I generate a fertigation schedule in the app?\nA: To generate a fertigation schedule, follow these steps:\n\n    1. Go to \"My Farm\"\n    2. Select \"Fertigation\"\n    3. Tap \"Create Report\"\n    4. Fill in all the required details\n    5. Save the report\n    If you have soil, leaf, or petiole test data, you can input this for a more customized schedule. Otherwise, we can generate a basic schedule using general crop and regional data."

Beej ko 1-2 inch gehra lagana chahiye.\n\n3. **Mitti ki Taiyari**: Mitti ko achhe se khod kar usme organic khad milaen. Loam ya sandy loam mitti iske liye behtar hoti hai.\n\n4. **Paani dena**: Paudhe ko lagane ke baad, achhe se paani dena na bhoolen. Paani dene ka samay subah ya shaam ka hona chahiye.\n\n5. **Khad dena**: Paudhe ki vruddhi ke liye samay-samay par khad dena zaroori hai.

Choose the right site: Choose a place for black berries where there is good sunlight and good water drainage.\n\n2. Seed or plant: You can plant a plant from seed or from a nursery. Seeds should be planted 1-2 inches deep.\n\n3. Soil preparation: Dig the soil thoroughly and add organic manure to it. Loam or sandy loam soil is better for this.\n\n4. Watering: After planting the plant, don't forget to water it well. Watering time should be in the morning or evening.\n\n5. Fertilizing: Fertilizing is necessary from time to time for the growth of the plant. You can use organic or chemical fertilizers.\n\n6. Disease and Pest Control: Spray the pesticide on time to protect the plant from disease and pests.\n\n7. Pruning: Pruning is also necessary for good growth of the plant.\n\nIf you encounter any particular problem, you can let me know.",

If there is a shortage of water, the fruits do not develop to the right size.\n\n2. **Nutrient deficiency**: Especially if there is a lack of nutrients such as potassium and nitrogen, the distance between the fungi can increase.\n\n3. **Temperature changes**: Extreme temperatures or low temperatures can cause differences in the stems. Fruit growth is affected by a sudden change in temperature.\n\n4. **Crop health status**: If disease or pest worsens the health condition of the crop, there may be a gap in the stems.\n\n5. **Crop growth with age**: Sometimes, there may be a difference in the stems with the age of the crop, especially in the final stages of fruit development.\n\nIf you would like to know more about the condition of your crop, please seek advice to check the crop's health status or to check for nutrients.",

This will provide the necessary nutrients for new shoot development.\n\n3. **Watering**: Ensure adequate watering, especially during dry spells. Mango trees require consistent moisture for healthy growth.\n\n4. **Pest Control**: Monitor for pests that may affect new growth, such as aphids or mealybugs, and take appropriate control measures.\n\n5. **Mulching**: Apply organic mulch around the base of the tree to retain moisture and improve soil health.\n\n6. **Sunlight**: Ensure the tree receives sufficient sunlight, as mango trees thrive in bright conditions.\n\nBy implementing these practices, you can encourage healthy new shoot formation in your mango trees.",

Allow the soil to dry slightly before harvest.\n\n3. **Nutrient Management**: Apply balanced fertilizers, focusing on potassium and phosphorus, to enhance cane maturity.\n\n4. **Pest and Disease Control**: Monitor for pests and diseases that can affect cane health. Use appropriate pesticides and fungicides as needed.\n\n5. **Sunlight Exposure**: Ensure that the vines receive adequate sunlight by managing canopy growth. This helps in the ripening process.\n\n6. **Harvest Timing**: Monitor the sugar levels and acidity in the grapes to determine the optimal harvest time for mature canes.\n\nBy implementing these practices, you can promote healthy cane maturity in your grape crop.",

You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault.

Here are the potential issues identified:\n\n1. **Flea Beetles** (Possible Diagnosis)\n   - **Symptoms**: \n     - Feeding damage with yellowing on leaves.\n     - Small shot-like holes.\n     - Presence of small, dark, shiny, or metallic beetles.\n   - **Treatment**: \n     - Implement an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments if available. Insecticides should be applied during the beetle's susceptible period, particularly when they first appear on the leaves. Products containing chlorpyrifos are effective for controlling these populations.\n\n2. **Chilli Cercospora Leaf Spot** (Unlikely Diagnosis)\n   - **Symptoms**: \n     - Large concentric brown spots on leaves with a whitish center, dark ring, and yellow halo (often referred to as 'frog eye').\n     - Enlarging spots that develop into large lesions.\n     - Yellowing and dropping of leaves, which can expose fruits to sunscald.\n   - **Treatment**: \n     - Use an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments. Seed treatment with captan (3g/kg) is effective. Foliar sprays containing copper hydroxide, chlorothalonil, or mancozeb should be applied when spots first appear, continuing at 10-14 day intervals until 3-4 weeks before the last harvest. Ensure to spray both sides of the leaves.\n\n3. **Whiteflies** (Very Unlikely Diagnosis)\n   - **Symptoms**: \n     - Yellow spots on leaves.\n     - Development of deep black powdery mold.\n     - Leaf deformation with curling or cupping.\n     - Stunted growth and presence of small white to yellowish insects.\n   - **Treatment**: \n     - An integrated approach with preventive measures is crucial. Whiteflies can quickly develop resistance to pesticides, so rotating different products is advisable. Use products based on or combinations of bifenthrin, buprofezin, fenoxycarb, deltamethrin, azadirachtin, lambda-cyhalothrin, cypermethrin, pyrethroids, pymetrozine, or spiromesifen for control. Preventive measures can often keep populations at harmless levels.\n\n**Note**: It's essential to monitor your crops regularly and take action promptly to mitigate these issues.",

Benefits include:\n\n    1. More accurate nutrient recommendations\n    2. Better alignment with your crop's actual needs\n    3. Potential for improved crop health and yield\n    4. More efficient use of fertilizers\n    5. Possible reduction in fertilizer costs and environmental impact",
                        "Q: Why should I consider soil, leaf, or petiole testing?\nA: Soil, leaf, and petiole testing are crucial for effective plant health management. These tests provide specific data about your crop's nutrient needs, allowing for more precise fertilizer application. This can lead to higher productivity with optimized input use, potentially reducing costs and environmental impact.",
                        "Q: When should we take the petiole and soil samples?\nA: It varies crop-wise.",
                        "Q: Where can I add soil, leaf, or petiole test reports in the app?\nA: You can add test reports in two ways:\n\n    1. When creating a new report: Go to \"Fertigation,\" then \"Create Report,\" and input the details from your test results.\n    2. Upload copies: You can directly upload photocopies or scans of your test reports in the app. Look for an \"Upload Reports\" or similar option in the Fertigation section."

They are more common in temperate regions.\n   - **C4 Plants**: Adapted to hot, dry environments. They are more efficient in high temperatures and low CO2 concentrations.\n\n3. **Water Use Efficiency**:\n   - **C3 Plants**: Generally have lower water use efficiency and can suffer from photorespiration, especially in high temperatures.\n   - **C4 Plants**: More efficient in water use and have a mechanism to minimize photorespiration.\n\n4. **Examples**:\n   - **C3 Plants**: Wheat, rice, and most trees.\n   - **C4 Plants**: Maize (corn), sugarcane, and sorghum.\n\nThese differences influence how each type of plant grows and thrives in various environmental conditions.",

This capacity is crucial for the healthy growth of the plants, as it determines how much water is available for the vines to absorb between irrigation events.\n\n### Key Points about Water Storage in Grapes:\n\n1. **Soil Type**: Different soil types (e.g., sandy, loamy, clay) have varying water retention capacities. Loamy soils typically hold more water compared to sandy soils.\n\n2. **Root Depth**: The deeper the roots, the more water can be stored in the soil. Grapevines generally have deep root systems, which can access moisture from deeper soil layers.\n\n3. **Irrigation Management**: Understanding the water storage capacity helps in planning irrigation schedules. It allows farmers to apply the right amount of water at the right time, preventing over-irrigation or drought stress.\n\n4. **Monitoring**: Using soil moisture sensors can help monitor the water levels in the soil, ensuring that the grapevines receive adequate moisture without waterlogging.\n\n5. **Water Use Efficiency**: Efficient water management practices can enhance grape quality and yield while conserving water resources.\n\nBy managing the water tank effectively, grape growers can optimize vine health and improve grape production.",

Applying abscisic acid as a fertilizer supplement can help reduce sunburn damage. Anti-transpirant products that minimize water loss from leaves may also be beneficial.\n\n2. **Pesticide Damage** (Very Unlikely Diagnosis)\n   - **Symptoms**: Leaf spots or larger patches, yellowing and wilting leaves, scorch or tip burn.\n   - **Treatment**: Use pesticides according to instructions to avoid damage. In case of severe injury, you can spray urea at 10 g/l of water or polyfeed at the same concentration.\n\n3. **Potassium Deficiency** (Very Unlikely Diagnosis)\n   - **Symptoms**: Yellowing of leaves starting from the margins, dark green main veins, curled leaves, and stunted growth.\n   - **Treatment**: Use potassium-containing fertilizers like muriate of potash (MOP) or potassium nitrate (KNO3). It's advisable to conduct a soil test before the cropping season to optimize production.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Monitor the plants closely and consider implementing the suggested treatments.\n- Consult with an agricultural advisor for tailored advice based on your soil and crop conditions.",

Magnesium can be applied directly to the soil or through foliar sprays.\n\n2. **Potassium Deficiency** (Likelihood: Unlikely)\n   - **Symptoms**: \n     - Yellowing of leaves starting from the margins.\n     - Main veins remain dark green.\n     - Curled leaves and stunted growth.\n   - **Treatment**: \n     - Use fertilizers containing potassium (e.g., muriate of potash, potassium nitrate).\n     - Consult with an agricultural advisor for the best product and dosage.\n   - **Recommendation**: Apply fertilizers during field preparation and at flowering, as crops absorb potassium more efficiently through soil fertilization.\n\n3. **Nitrogen Deficiency** (Likelihood: Very Unlikely)\n   - **Symptoms**: \n     - Discoloration of leaves (pale green, light red petioles and veins).\n     - Stunted leaf growth and long, thin appearance of the plant.\n   - **Treatment**: \n     - Use fertilizers containing nitrogen (e.g., Urea, NPK, ammonium nitrate).\n     - Consult with an agricultural advisor for the best product and dosage.\n   - **Recommendation**: Apply nitrogen in multiple splits throughout the season, avoiding application close to harvest time.\n\nPlease consider these recommendations and consult with an agricultural expert for tailored advice.",

You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault. If the soil moisture sensor reading is consistently at 0 from few 48 hours, then it could be anamolous (use live and historical hourly soil moisture data (use tool) to validate)."

                "content": "Soil retention refers to the ability of soil to hold water, which is crucial for crop growth. It can be influenced by soil texture, structure, and organic matter content. Here's a general approach to calculate soil retention:\n\n1. **Determine Soil Texture**: Identify the soil texture (e.g., sandy, loamy, clayey) as it affects water retention capacity.\n\n2. **Use Soil Retention Curves**: Soil retention curves provide data on how much water different soil types can hold at various moisture levels. You can find these curves in agricultural research or soil science literature.\n\n3. **Calculate Field Capacity and Wilting Point**:\n   - **Field Capacity**: The amount of water soil can hold after excess water has drained away (usually around 0.1 to 0.3 bar tension).\n   - **Wilting Point**: The moisture level at which plants can no longer extract water (usually around 1.5 bar tension).\n\n4. **Soil Water Holding Capacity**: The difference between field capacity and wilting point gives you the available water capacity (AWC):\n   \\[\n   \\text{AWC} = \\text{Field Capacity} - \\text{Wilting Point}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Estimate Soil Retention**: The total soil retention can be estimated based on the depth of the root zone and the AWC:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Soil Retention} = \\text{AWC} \\times \\text{Root Depth}\n   \\]\n\nIf you have specific values for your soil type or need further assistance, please provide those details!",

                        "Q: How do I know if my soil  moisture sensor is working fine ?\nA: The only way to know is if after irrigation the sensor is dropping below 5 kpa and increasing continuously unless next irrigation is done. You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault. If the soil moisture sensor reading is consistently at 0 from few 48 hours, then it could be anamolous (use live and historical hourly soil moisture data (use tool) to validate).",
                        "Q: How to calibrate soil moisture sensors ?\nA:  The way to calibrate sensors is by putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. A drop after watering or irrigation and continuous dry upto 200 kpa means that the sensor is calibrated.",
                        "Q: What should I do if the soil moisture sensor values fluctuate?\nA: Ensure the sensor is installed properly in the soil, check for air bubbles, and contact Fyllo representative if the issue persists.",
                        "Q: Sensor is showing wet, i.e. less kpa but soil looks dry.\nA: The sensor measures the moisture around the rootzone which is not visible from the top. Ask use to check the moisture in rootzone around the sensor. If it matches, ask the user to irrigate.",
                        "Q: Sensor is showing dry, but it rained recently.\nA: Rainwater doesn't percolate well in the soil. Most of it runs off. After a day of rain stops , if the sensor is still dry, you will have to irrigate. You can check the moisture by digging near the sensor . Irrigate accordingly."

How to use the irrigation hours calculator?\nA: To calculate irrigation hours in the Fyllo app, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the Fyllo App\n2. Go to the home screen\n3. Click on the soil moisture-1 sensor\n4. Scroll down to find the \"Irrigation hours\" section\n5. Fill in the required details such as:\n   - Root width (inches)\n   - Root depth (inches)\n   - Soil retention (mm)\n   - Dripper distance (feet)\n   - Dripper discharge (liters)\n6. Click the calculate button\n\nWould you like me to calculate the irrigation hours for you right now? I can retrieve your plot's irrigation settings and perform the calculation if you say yes.\n\nTool Selection: When user says yes, I should:\n1. Use get_irrigation_installation_settings tool to retrieve plot settings\n2. Check if all values are present and valid\n3. If values are valid, use calculate_irrigation_hours tool with these values\n4. If values are missing or invalid, ask the user to provide the missing values\n5. After calculating irrigation hours, display the irrigation installation settings that were used for the calculation\n6. Ask the user if they want to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values, and if yes, prompt them to provide those values\n\nExample response if values are missing:\n\"I checked your plot settings, but I need some additional information to calculate irrigation hours accurately. Could you please provide the [missing value(s)]? Once you provide these details, I can complete the calculation for you.\"\n\nExample response after calculation:\n\"Based on your plot's irrigation settings, the calculated irrigation hours are [X] hours. \n\nI used the following settings for this calculation:\n- Root width: [value] inches\n- Root depth: [value] inches\n- Soil retention: [value] mm\n- Dripper distance: [value] feet\n- Dripper discharge: [value] liters\n\nWould you like to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values? If yes, please provide the new values you'd like to use.\""

How to use the irrigation hours calculator?\nA: To calculate irrigation hours in the Fyllo app, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the Fyllo App\n2. Go to the home screen\n3. Click on the soil moisture-1 sensor\n4. Scroll down to find the \"Irrigation hours\" section\n5. Fill in the required details such as:\n   - Root width (inches)\n   - Root depth (inches)\n   - Soil retention (mm)\n   - Dripper distance (feet)\n   - Dripper discharge (liters)\n6. Click the calculate button\n\nWould you like me to calculate the irrigation hours for you right now? I can retrieve your plot's irrigation settings and perform the calculation if you say yes.\n\nTool Selection: When user says yes, I should:\n1. Use get_irrigation_installation_settings tool to retrieve plot settings\n2. Check if all values are present and valid\n3. If values are valid, use calculate_irrigation_hours tool with these values\n4. If values are missing or invalid, ask the user to provide the missing values\n5. After calculating irrigation hours, display the irrigation installation settings that were used for the calculation\n6. Ask the user if they want to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values, and if yes, prompt them to provide those values\n\nExample response if values are missing:\n\"I checked your plot settings, but I need some additional information to calculate irrigation hours accurately. Could you please provide the [missing value(s)]? Once you provide these details, I can complete the calculation for you.\"\n\nExample response after calculation:\n\"Based on your plot's irrigation settings, the calculated irrigation hours are [X] hours. \n\nI used the following settings for this calculation:\n- Root width: [value] inches\n- Root depth: [value] inches\n- Soil retention: [value] mm\n- Dripper distance: [value] feet\n- Dripper discharge: [value] liters\n\nWould you like to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values? If yes, please provide the new values you'd like to use.\""

                        "Q: How do I know if my soil  moisture sensor is working fine ?\nA: The only way to know is if after irrigation the sensor is dropping below 5 kpa and increasing continuously unless next irrigation is done. You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault. If the soil moisture sensor reading is consistently at 0 from few 48 hours, then it could be anamolous (use live and historical hourly soil moisture data (use tool) to validate).",

                        "Q: How to calibrate soil moisture sensors ?\nA:  The way to calibrate sensors is by putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. A drop after watering or irrigation and continuous dry upto 200 kpa means that the sensor is calibrated.",
                        "Q: In the latest irrigation , sensor didn't drop to 0.\nA: 0 to 5 Kpa means soil is fully wet. It need not drop to 0 every time. Moisture less than 5 also means wet conditions. So, need not worry. Also ask to wait for 12 hours after irrigation."

You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault.

If necessary, create drainage channels to direct excess water away from the roots.\n   - **Raised Beds**: If waterlogging is a recurring issue, consider planting in raised beds to improve drainage.\n\n3. **Fertilization**:\n   - **Balanced Fertilizer**: Apply a balanced fertilizer to provide essential nutrients that may be lacking due to water saturation. This can help stimulate shoot growth.\n\n4. **Monitor Soil Moisture**:\n   - **Check Soil Moisture Levels**: Use a moisture meter to ensure that the soil is not overly saturated. Wait for the soil to dry out to optimal moisture levels before further irrigation.\n\n5. **Pest and Disease Management**:\n   - **Inspect for Pests/Diseases**: After heavy rainfall, check for any signs of pests or diseases that may affect shoot growth. Treat accordingly.\n\n6. **Mulching**:\n   - **Apply Mulch**: Use organic mulch to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and improve soil structure over time.\n\nBy implementing these practices, you can enhance soil aeration and support healthy shoot development in your grape crop.",

Here are some key points about sorghum farming:\n\n1. **Soil Requirements**: Sorghum thrives in well-drained, loamy soils with good organic matter. It can tolerate poor soil conditions but performs best in fertile soils.\n\n2. **Sowing Time**: The ideal time for sowing sorghum in India is during the Kharif season (June to July) and Rabi season (October to November), depending on the region.\n\n3. **Seed Rate**: The recommended seed rate is about 8-12 kg per acre, depending on the variety and soil fertility.\n\n4. **Fertilization**: A balanced fertilizer application is crucial. Typically, 20-25 kg of nitrogen, 40-50 kg of phosphorus, and 20-25 kg of potassium per acre are recommended.\n\n5. **Irrigation**: Sorghum is drought-resistant but requires adequate moisture during the critical growth stages. Irrigation should be done based on soil moisture levels.\n\n6. **Pest and Disease Management**: Common pests include shoot fly, stem borer, and aphids. Regular monitoring and timely application of pesticides are essential. Diseases like downy mildew and ergot can also affect yields.\n\n7. **Harvesting**: Sorghum is usually ready for harvest 90-120 days after sowing, depending on the variety. Harvest when the grains are hard and the leaves start to dry.\n\n8. **Uses**: Sorghum is used for food, fodder, and biofuel. It is a staple food in many regions and is rich in nutrients.\n\nIf you need specific guidance or have questions about sorghum farming practices, feel free to ask!",

Here are some specific practices for cultivating sorghum as fodder:\n\n1. **Variety Selection**: Choose fodder-specific varieties of sorghum, such as Sudan grass or forage sorghum, which are bred for high biomass and digestibility.\n\n2. **Soil Preparation**: Prepare the soil by plowing and harrowing to create a fine seedbed. Ensure good drainage and incorporate organic matter to improve soil fertility.\n\n3. **Sowing Time**: The best time to sow sorghum for fodder is during the Kharif season (June to July) or Rabi season (October to November), depending on your region.\n\n4. **Seed Rate**: Use a seed rate of about 10-15 kg per acre for fodder production. This higher density helps in achieving better biomass.\n\n5. **Fertilization**: Apply balanced fertilizers based on soil tests. Generally, 30-40 kg of nitrogen, 20-30 kg of phosphorus, and 20-30 kg of potassium per acre are recommended for optimal growth.\n\n6. **Irrigation**: Sorghum is drought-tolerant but requires adequate moisture during the early growth stages. Irrigate based on soil moisture levels, especially during dry spells.\n\n7. **Pest and Disease Management**: Monitor for pests like aphids and stem borers. Use integrated pest management practices, including biological control and timely pesticide application. Diseases like downy mildew should also be monitored.\n\n8. **Harvesting**: For fodder, sorghum can be harvested when it reaches a height of about 3-4 feet, usually 60-90 days after sowing. Cut the plants at the base to encourage regrowth.\n\n9. **Regrowth**: Sorghum has good regrowth potential. After the first cut, allow the plants to regrow for subsequent cuts, which can be done every 4-6 weeks.\n\n10. **Nutritional Value**: Sorghum fodder is rich in protein and energy, making it suitable for livestock feed. It can be fed fresh or preserved as silage.\n\nBy following these practices, you can effectively cultivate sorghum for fodder, ensuring a sustainable and nutritious feed source for your livestock.
