The disease is caused by various species of fungi, primarily from the genera Colletotrichum and Gloeosporium. \n\n### Symptoms:\n- **Leaves:** Dark, water-soaked spots that may enlarge and become sunken.\n- **Stems:** Cankers or lesions that can girdle the stem, leading to wilting and dieback.\n- **Fruits:** Sunken, dark lesions that can cause fruit rot.\n\n### Management:\n- **Cultural Practices:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris, avoid overhead watering, and ensure proper plant spacing for good air circulation.\n- **Chemical Control:** Use fungicides as a preventive measure, especially during wet and humid conditions.\n- **Resistant Varieties:** Plant resistant or tolerant varieties if available.\n\nRegular monitoring and early intervention are key to managing anthracnose effectively.",

The soil texture and the crop rooting depth determine this. A deeper rooting depth means there is a larger volume of water stored in the soil and therefore a larger reservoir of water for the crop to draw upon between irrigations. Knowing the soil water storage capacity allows the irrigator to determine how much water to apply at one time and how long to wait between each irrigation. For example, the amount of water applied at one time on a sandy soil, which has a low soil water storage capacity, would be less than for a loam soil, which has a higher soil water storage capacity."

You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault.

This indicates that evaporation rates may be low, possibly due to cooler temperatures or recent rainfall.\n\n### Possible Reasons for Slow Increase in Soil Moisture (11 kPa):\n- **Crop Stage**: The vegetative growth stage may lead to slower transpiration, resulting in a gradual increase in soil moisture.\n- **Environmental Factors**: The lack of evapotranspiration data suggests that evaporation may be low, which can contribute to the slow increase in moisture levels.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Check Weather Conditions**: Monitor the temperature and rainfall in your area, as these can significantly affect evaporation rates.\n- **Physical Check**: If you suspect the sensor readings are inaccurate, consider checking the soil moisture physically around the sensor by digging.\n\nIf you would like to raise a support ticket for further investigation or if you have any other concerns, please let me know!",

Typical nutrient needs for your crop type\n    2. General soil characteristics common in your region\n    3. Standard growing practices for your area\n    This schedule provides a starting point, but may not be as precise as one based on specific test data.",

            "Q: I irrigated still the sensor is showing dry.\nA: Ask user when he irrigated. It usually takes 12 hours to reach the water till sensor. If the sensor is not dropping even after 12 hours, it can be due to one of the following reasons :\nWater is not reaching properly till the sensor , this can be due to drip blocked , or slope in the land or dripper outlets far away from the sensor. Ask user to check if drip is fine and  dripper is within the range of sensor. \nThe sensor can be very old , more than two years , in this case , the sensor might be malfunction, ask user if he wants to raise a ticket",
            "Q: I irrigated still the sensor is dropping slowly.\nA: Sometimes, the water reaches slowly till root zone and the moisture sensor kPa value drops slowly. Always wait for 12 hours after irrigation for the moisture to saturate. If still some confusion, ask user to check moisture near the sensor and check if he wants to raise a ticket for the issue.",
            "Q: How to calibrate soil moisture sensors ?\nA:  The way to calibrate sensors is by putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. A drop after watering or irrigation and continuous dry upto 200 kpa means that the sensor is calibrated.",
            "Q: What should I do if the soil moisture sensor always shows wet values?\nA: Verify the irrigation frequency, check the installation point, and contact Fyllo representative if the issue persists.",
            "Q: In the latest irrigation , sensor didn't drop to 0.\nA: 0 to 5 Kpa means soil is fully wet. It need not drop to 0 every time. Moisture less than 5 also means wet conditions. So, need not worry. Also ask to wait for 12 hours after irrigation."

You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault.

If there no , tell the user that kPa increase is normal.\nIf there is rapid increase recently, check if the crop stag is near full fruit growth or harvesting.

You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault. If the soil moisture sensor reading is consistently at 0 from few 48 hours, then it could be anamolous (use live and historical hourly soil moisture data (use tool) to validate).",

A drop after watering or irrigation and continuous dry upto 200 kpa means that the sensor is calibrated.",

It can be due to following :\nIf the device is recently installed, there can be moisture  around the sensor because the sensor is dipped in the water before installing. If this is the case, ask them to do atleast 3 irrigations as per their previous schedule without sensors and sensors would b set by then.\nIf the crop stage is very early or pruing is done recently, the water takeup by plants is negligible in this period because of very less transpiration. If this is the case, ask them to wait till irrigation Kpa in the present stage.\nSometimes, the water can remain accumulated around the sensor due to local landscaping or slope in the land around sensor. In this case, please check the around the sensor. It will have to be reinstalled properly. Chatbot should ask the user if he wants to create an issue ticket for the same"

Some common causes are as follows:\n\n1. **Availability of water**: If there is a shortage of water in your area or the water source is not functioning properly, the return of drinking water may decrease.\n\n2. **Soil condition**: Soil health and structure also influence the return of the drink. If the soil is less nutritious or doesn't have the right moisture, the return of the drink can be reduced.\n\n3. **Crop stage**: The growth and development stage of crops also influence the return of the crop. If crops don't grow properly, the return of the drink may decline.\n\n4. **Requirement**: Water requirement varies according to the growth stage of the crop. If crops are still small, they may require less water.\n\nIf you would like more information on how to increase water supply according to the special needs of your crops, please let us know.",

Spray every two weeks from bud break until fruit coloring begins.\n\n### 2. **Grape Rust**\n- **Symptoms**: \n  - Orange-brown powdery masses on the underside of leaves.\n  - Premature leaf drop.\n- **Treatment**: \n  - Use fungicides like Bordeaux mixture, difolatan, propiconazole, tebuconazole, or azoxystrobin.\n  - Apply 3-4 sprays of Baycor (0.1%) at fortnight intervals during the growing season.\n\n### 3. **Downy Mildew of Grape**\n- **Symptoms**: \n  - Yellowish-green oily spots with a brownish halo on leaves.\n  - Irregular brown patches.\n  - White to grayish cottony coat under the spots.\n  - Can affect shoots, tendrils, and inflorescence.\n  - Stunted growth.\n- **Treatment**: \n  - Use protectant fungicides, ensuring proper application to the underside of leaves.\n  - Copper-based fungicides like Bordeaux mixture and dithiocarbamates are recommended.\n  - Post-infection fungicides should be applied immediately after symptoms appear.\n\n### Notes\nIt's crucial to follow good cultural practices and monitor your crop regularly to manage these diseases effectively.",

            "Q: How do I know if my soil  moisture sensor is working fine ?\nA: The only way to know is if after irrigation the sensor is dropping below 5 kpa and increasing continuously unless next irrigation is done. You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault. If the soil moisture sensor reading is consistently at 0 from few 48 hours, then it could be anamolous (use live and historical hourly soil moisture data (use tool) to validate)."

If there no , tell the user that kPa increase is normal.\nIf there is rapid increase recently, check if the crop stag is near full fruit growth or harvesting. In the later stages , crop transpiration is very high , thus there is a rapid increase in soil moisture Kpa meaning decrease in moisture in the soil. Also, the moisture drop can be due to high evaporation recently. Check if there is temperature increase meaning high evaporation recently.\nIf the above two are not the cases, ask user to check the moisture physically near the sensor.

Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault.

A drop after watering or irrigation and continuous dry upto 200 kpa means that the sensor is calibrated."

A drop after watering or irrigation and continuous dry upto 200 kpa means that the sensor is calibrated.",

Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault.

You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault. If the soil moisture sensor reading is consistently at 0 from few 48 hours, then it could be anamolous (use live and historical hourly soil moisture data (use tool) to validate).",

            "Q: How do I know if my soil  moisture sensor is working fine ?\nA: The only way to know is if after irrigation the sensor is dropping below 5 kpa and increasing continuously unless next irrigation is done. You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault. If the soil moisture sensor reading is consistently at 0 from few 48 hours, then it could be anamolous (use live and historical hourly soil moisture data (use tool) to validate).",
            "Q: How to calibrate soil moisture sensors ?\nA:  The way to calibrate sensors is by putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. A drop after watering or irrigation and continuous dry upto 200 kpa means that the sensor is calibrated.",
            "Q: What should I do if the soil moisture sensor values fluctuate?\nA: Ensure the sensor is installed properly in the soil, check for air bubbles, and contact Fyllo representative if the issue persists.",
            "Q: Sensor is showing dry, but it rained recently.\nA: Rainwater doesn't percolate well in the soil. Most of it runs off. After a day of rain stops , if the sensor is still dry, you will have to irrigate. You can check the moisture by digging near the sensor . Irrigate accordingly.",
            "Q: Sensor is showing wet, i.e. less kpa but soil looks dry.\nA: The sensor measures the moisture around the rootzone which is not visible from the top. Ask use to check the moisture in rootzone around the sensor. If it matches, ask the user to irrigate."

Is my device sending data? Are my all devices working properly? Is my device online? Is my device connected? What is the status of my device? Is my Fyllo device transmitting data?\nA: If device is sending data proactively, then it is working fine. If user has not recharged the device, then it will not work, and user should do recharge. If recharge is also active, then there is some issue, user should raise a support ticket in the Fyllo App.\n\nI'll check the payment status of your device for you.\n\nTool Selection: I should use the JSON data from farmer_plots_details to check:\n1. If isDataPlanActive is true\n2. If planRechargeExpiryDate is in the future\n3. If deviceLatestDataAvailable is true\n4. What the deviceMessage says\n\nResponse Logic:\n- If isDataPlanActive is true AND planRechargeExpiryDate is future date:\n  \"Your recharge plan is active until [expiry date].\"\n- If isDataPlanActive is false OR planRechargeExpiryDate is past date:\n  \"It appears your recharge plan is not currently active. If you've recently made a payment, please allow some time for it to be processed. If the issue persists, please contact our support team. Would you like the contact details of our support team?\"\n- Additionally, if deviceLatestDataAvailable is true:\n  \"Your device is currently active and sending data properly.\"\n- If deviceLatestDataAvailable is false:\n  \"Your device is not currently sending data. This might be due to connectivity issues.\"\n\nExample final response:\n\"Your payment has been successfully processed. Your recharge plan is active until June 5, 2025.

            "Q: Why should I consider soil, leaf, or petiole testing?\nA: Soil, leaf, and petiole testing are crucial for effective plant health management. These tests provide specific data about your crop's nutrient needs, allowing for more precise fertilizer application. This can lead to higher productivity with optimized input use, potentially reducing costs and environmental impact.",
            "Q: What are the advantages of adding soil, leaf, or petiole test reports?\nA: By adding test reports, Fyllo can generate a more precise fertigation schedule tailored to your specific conditions. Benefits include:\n\n    1. More accurate nutrient recommendations\n    2. Better alignment with your crop's actual needs\n    3. Potential for improved crop health and yield\n    4. More efficient use of fertilizers\n    5. Possible reduction in fertilizer costs and environmental impact",
            "Q: Where can I add soil, leaf, or petiole test reports in the app?\nA: You can add test reports in two ways:\n\n    1. When creating a new report: Go to \"Fertigation,\" then \"Create Report,\" and input the details from your test results.\n    2. Upload copies: You can directly upload photocopies or scans of your test reports in the app. Look for an \"Upload Reports\" or similar option in the Fertigation section.",
            "Q: What should I do if the soil moisture sensor values fluctuate?\nA: Ensure the sensor is installed properly in the soil, check for air bubbles, and contact Fyllo representative if the issue persists.",
            "Q: What should I do if the soil moisture sensor always shows wet values?\nA: Verify the irrigation frequency, check the installation point, and contact Fyllo representative if the issue persists."

A higher LAI generally indicates a healthier crop with more leaf area for photosynthesis.\n2. **Yield Prediction**: It can be used to predict crop yields, as more leaf area typically correlates with higher productivity.\n3. **Water and Nutrient Management**: LAI can guide irrigation and fertilization practices by indicating the plant's growth stage and nutrient needs.\n\n### Interpretation:\n- **Low LAI**: Indicates sparse foliage, which may suggest poor growth, nutrient deficiency, or water stress.\n- **Optimal LAI**: Represents healthy growth, indicating that the crop is well-nourished and has adequate water.\n- **High LAI**: While it can indicate vigorous growth, excessively high LAI may lead to shading and reduced light penetration, potentially affecting lower leaves and overall yield.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMonitoring LAI helps farmers make informed decisions regarding crop management, ensuring optimal growth conditions and maximizing yield potential.",

So, while reading 0 KPa, you experience 100% moist soil.\n- **Percentage reading**: 0% means the soil is dry, while 100% means the soil is moist.\n\n### Example:\nIf your old sensor has given a 0 KPa reading, it represents 100% damp soil.\nIf you get 25% of the reading, it indicates 75% dry soil, i.e. close to 200 KPa.\n\nThe difference in your sensor's readings will allow you to understand water needs and soil conditions.

How to use the irrigation hours calculator?\nA: To calculate irrigation hours in the Fyllo app, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the Fyllo App\n2. Go to the home screen\n3. Click on the soil moisture-1 sensor\n4. Scroll down to find the \"Irrigation hours\" section\n5. Fill in the required details such as:\n   - Root width (inches)\n   - Root depth (inches)\n   - Soil retention (mm)\n   - Dripper distance (feet)\n   - Dripper discharge (liters)\n6.

Use get_irrigation_installation_settings tool to retrieve plot settings\n2. Check if all values are present and valid\n3. If values are valid, use calculate_irrigation_hours tool with these values\n4. If values are missing or invalid, ask the user to provide the missing values\n5. After calculating irrigation hours, display the irrigation installation settings that were used for the calculation\n6. Ask the user if they want to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values, and if yes, prompt them to provide those values\n\nExample response if values are missing:\n\"I checked your plot settings, but I need some additional information to calculate irrigation hours accurately. Could you please provide the [missing value(s)]? Once you provide these details, I can complete the calculation for you.\"\n\nExample response after calculation:\n\"Based on your plot's irrigation settings, the calculated irrigation hours are [X] hours. \n\nI used the following settings for this calculation:\n- Root width: [value] inches\n- Root depth: [value] inches\n- Soil retention: [value] mm\n- Dripper distance: [value] feet\n- Dripper discharge: [value] liters\n\nWould you like to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values?

Use appropriate pesticides and fungicides as needed.\n\n5. **Sunlight Exposure**: Ensure that the vines receive adequate sunlight by managing canopy growth. This helps in the ripening process.\n\n6. **Harvest Timing**: Monitor the sugar levels and acidity in the grapes to determine the optimal harvest time for mature canes.\n\nBy implementing these practices, you can promote healthy cane maturity in your grape crop.",

You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault. If the soil moisture sensor reading is consistently at 0 from few 48 hours, then it could be anamolous (use live and historical hourly soil moisture data (use tool) to validate).",

It can be due to following :\nIf the device is recently installed, there can be moisture  around the sensor because the sensor is dipped in the water before installing. If this is the case, ask them to do atleast 3 irrigations as per their previous schedule without sensors and sensors would b set by then.\nIf the crop stage is very early or pruing is done recently, the water takeup by plants is negligible in this period because of very less transpiration. If this is the case, ask them to wait till irrigation Kpa in the present stage.\nSometimes, the water can remain accumulated around the sensor due to local landscaping or slope in the land around sensor. In this case, please check the around the sensor. It will have to be reinstalled properly. Chatbot should ask the user if he wants to create an issue ticket for the same"

        "content": "The analysis of your crop image indicates that the health of your green chilli plants is currently unhealthy. Here are the potential issues identified:\n\n1. **Flea Beetles** (Possible Diagnosis)\n   - **Symptoms**: \n     - Feeding damage with yellowing on leaves.\n     - Small shot-like holes.\n     - Presence of small, dark, shiny, or metallic beetles.\n   - **Treatment**: \n     - Implement an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments if available. Insecticides should be applied during the beetle's susceptible period, particularly when they first appear on the leaves. Products containing chlorpyrifos are effective for controlling these populations.\n\n2. **Chilli Cercospora Leaf Spot** (Unlikely Diagnosis)\n   - **Symptoms**: \n     - Large concentric brown spots on leaves with a whitish center, dark ring, and yellow halo (often referred to as 'frog eye').\n     - Enlarging spots that develop into large lesions.\n     - Yellowing and dropping of leaves, which can expose fruits to sunscald.\n   - **Treatment**: \n     - Use an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments. Seed treatment with captan (3g/kg) is effective. Foliar sprays containing copper hydroxide, chlorothalonil, or mancozeb should be applied when spots first appear, continuing at 10-14 day intervals until 3-4 weeks before the last harvest. Ensure to spray both sides of the leaves.\n\n3. **Whiteflies** (Very Unlikely Diagnosis)\n   - **Symptoms**: \n     - Yellow spots on leaves.\n     - Development of deep black powdery mold.\n     - Leaf deformation with curling or cupping.\n     - Stunted growth and presence of small white to yellowish insects.\n   - **Treatment**: \n     - An integrated approach with preventive measures is crucial. Whiteflies can quickly develop resistance to pesticides, so rotating different products is advisable. Use products based on or combinations of bifenthrin, buprofezin, fenoxycarb, deltamethrin, azadirachtin, lambda-cyhalothrin, cypermethrin, pyrethroids, pymetrozine, or spiromesifen for control. Preventive measures can often keep populations at harmless levels.\n\n**Note**: It's essential to monitor your crops regularly and take action promptly to mitigate these issues.",

Benefits include:\n\n    1. More accurate nutrient recommendations\n    2. Better alignment with your crop's actual needs\n    3. Potential for improved crop health and yield\n    4. More efficient use of fertilizers\n    5. Possible reduction in fertilizer costs and environmental impact",
            "Q: Why should I consider soil, leaf, or petiole testing?\nA: Soil, leaf, and petiole testing are crucial for effective plant health management. These tests provide specific data about your crop's nutrient needs, allowing for more precise fertilizer application. This can lead to higher productivity with optimized input use, potentially reducing costs and environmental impact.",
            "Q: When should we take the petiole and soil samples?\nA: It varies crop-wise.",
            "Q: Where can I add soil, leaf, or petiole test reports in the app?\nA: You can add test reports in two ways:\n\n    1. When creating a new report: Go to \"Fertigation,\" then \"Create Report,\" and input the details from your test results.\n    2. Upload copies: You can directly upload photocopies or scans of your test reports in the app. Look for an \"Upload Reports\" or similar option in the Fertigation section."

Chemical options include wettable sulfur (3 g/l), spiromesifen (1 ml/l), or abamectin. A second spray 2-3 days after the initial treatment is recommended.\n\n2. **Chilli Thrips**:\n   - **Symptoms**: Leaves curling upwards, early defoliation, affected flowers and fruits, and small slender insects with blackish-brown bodies and yellowish wings.\n   - **Likelihood**: Unlikely.\n   - **Treatment**: Foliar sprays containing malathion are recommended. Other pesticides like abamectin can also help reduce their population.\n\n3. **Cucumber Mosaic Virus**:\n   - **Symptoms**: Mosaic patterns on leaves and fruits, brown spots and chlorotic patches, deformation and crinkling of leaves, and stunted growth.\n   - **Likelihood**: Very unlikely.\n   - **Treatment**: There are no effective chemicals against CMV. Insecticides containing cypermethrin or chlorpyrifos can be used against aphids to prevent infection.\n\n**Notes**: It's essential to adopt an integrated pest management strategy, combining chemical treatments with biological controls where possible.",

They are more common in temperate regions.\n   - **C4 Plants**: Adapted to hot, dry environments. They are more efficient in high temperatures and low CO2 concentrations.\n\n3. **Water Use Efficiency**:\n   - **C3 Plants**: Generally have lower water use efficiency and can suffer from photorespiration, especially in high temperatures.\n   - **C4 Plants**: More efficient in water use and have a mechanism to minimize photorespiration.\n\n4. **Examples**:\n   - **C3 Plants**: Wheat, rice, and most trees.\n   - **C4 Plants**: Maize (corn), sugarcane, and sorghum.\n\nThese differences influence how each type of plant grows and thrives in various environmental conditions.",

            "Q: What is soil water storage (water tank of crop)?\nA: Soil water storage is defined as the total amount of water that is stored in the soil within the plant’s root zone. The soil texture and the crop rooting depth determine this. A deeper rooting depth means there is a larger volume of water stored in the soil and therefore a larger reservoir of water for the crop to draw upon between irrigations. Knowing the soil water storage capacity allows the irrigator to determine how much water to apply at one time and how long to wait between each irrigation. For example, the amount of water applied at one time on a sandy soil, which has a low soil water storage capacity, would be less than for a loam soil, which has a higher soil water storage capacity."

        "content": "In a grape field, the \"water tank\" refers to the soil's capacity to store water within the root zone of the grapevines. This capacity is crucial for the healthy growth of the plants, as it determines how much water is available for the vines to absorb between irrigation events.\n\n### Key Points about Water Storage in Grapes:\n\n1. **Soil Type**: Different soil types (e.g., sandy, loamy, clay) have varying water retention capacities. Loamy soils typically hold more water compared to sandy soils.\n\n2. **Root Depth**: The deeper the roots, the more water can be stored in the soil. Grapevines generally have deep root systems, which can access moisture from deeper soil layers.\n\n3. **Irrigation Management**: Understanding the water storage capacity helps in planning irrigation schedules. It allows farmers to apply the right amount of water at the right time, preventing over-irrigation or drought stress.\n\n4. **Monitoring**: Using soil moisture sensors can help monitor the water levels in the soil, ensuring that the grapevines receive adequate moisture without waterlogging.\n\n5. **Water Use Efficiency**: Efficient water management practices can enhance grape quality and yield while conserving water resources.\n\nBy managing the water tank effectively, grape growers can optimize vine health and improve grape production.",

            "Q: What is soil water storage (water tank of crop)?\nA: Soil water storage is defined as the total amount of water that is stored in the soil within the plant’s root zone. The soil texture and the crop rooting depth determine this. A deeper rooting depth means there is a larger volume of water stored in the soil and therefore a larger reservoir of water for the crop to draw upon between irrigations. Knowing the soil water storage capacity allows the irrigator to determine how much water to apply at one time and how long to wait between each irrigation. For example, the amount of water applied at one time on a sandy soil, which has a low soil water storage capacity, would be less than for a loam soil, which has a higher soil water storage capacity."

This is typically between 1 to 3 feet (30 to 90 cm) for grapevines.\n\n2. **Identify Soil Texture**: Determine the soil texture (e.g., sandy, loamy, clay) as it affects water retention capacity.\n\n3. **Use Soil Water Holding Capacity**: Refer to standard values for water holding capacity based on soil texture:\n   - Sandy Soil: 0.05 to 0.1 inches of water per inch of soil\n   - Loamy Soil: 0.1 to 0.2 inches of water per inch of soil\n   - Clay Soil: 0.2 to 0.3 inches of water per inch of soil\n\n4. **Calculate Total Water Storage**:\n   - Formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Water Storage (in inches)} = \\text{Soil Depth (in inches)} \\times \\text{Water Holding Capacity (in inches per inch of soil)}\n     \\]\n   - For example, if you have 24 inches of loamy soil:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Water Storage} = 24 \\, \\text{inches} \\times 0.15 \\, \\text{inches/inch} = 3.6 \\, \\text{inches}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Convert to Volume**: If needed, convert the total water storage from inches to gallons or liters based on the area of the vineyard:\n   - 1 inch of water over 1 acre = 27,154 gallons (approximately 102,000 liters).\n\n### Example Calculation:\n- **Soil Depth**: 24 inches\n- **Soil Type**: Loamy (0.15 inches of water per inch of soil)\n- **Total Water Storage**:\n  \\[\n  24 \\, \\text{inches} \\times 0.15 \\, \\text{inches/inch} = 3.6 \\, \\text{inches}\n  \\]\n- **Area of Vineyard**: 1 acre\n- **Total Volume**:\n  \\[\n  3.6 \\, \\text{inches} \\times 27,154 \\, \\text{gallons/inch} = 97,800 \\, \\text{gallons}\n  \\]\n\nThis calculation helps you understand how much water is available in the soil for the grapevines and aids in planning irrigation schedules effectively.",

Click on the soil moisture-1 sensor\n4. Scroll down to find the \"Irrigation hours\" section\n5. Fill in the required details such as:\n   - Root width (inches)\n   - Root depth (inches)\n   - Soil retention (mm)\n   - Dripper distance (feet)\n   - Dripper discharge (liters)\n6. Click the calculate button\n\nWould you like me to calculate the irrigation hours for you right now? I can retrieve your plot's irrigation settings and perform the calculation if you say yes.\n\nTool Selection: When user says yes, I should:\n1. Use get_irrigation_installation_settings tool to retrieve plot settings\n2. Check if all values are present and valid\n3. If values are valid, use calculate_irrigation_hours tool with these values\n4. If values are missing or invalid, ask the user to provide the missing values\n5. After calculating irrigation hours, display the irrigation installation settings that were used for the calculation\n6. Ask the user if they want to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values, and if yes, prompt them to provide those values\n\nExample response if values are missing:\n\"I checked your plot settings, but I need some additional information to calculate irrigation hours accurately. Could you please provide the [missing value(s)]?

Applying abscisic acid as a fertilizer supplement can help reduce sunburn damage. Anti-transpirant products that minimize water loss from leaves may also be beneficial.\n\n2. **Pesticide Damage** (Very Unlikely Diagnosis)\n   - **Symptoms**: Leaf spots or larger patches, yellowing and wilting leaves, scorch or tip burn.\n   - **Treatment**: Use pesticides according to instructions to avoid damage. In case of severe injury, you can spray urea at 10 g/l of water or polyfeed at the same concentration.\n\n3. **Potassium Deficiency** (Very Unlikely Diagnosis)\n   - **Symptoms**: Yellowing of leaves starting from the margins, dark green main veins, curled leaves, and stunted growth.\n   - **Treatment**: Use potassium-containing fertilizers like muriate of potash (MOP) or potassium nitrate (KNO3). It's advisable to conduct a soil test before the cropping season to optimize production.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Monitor the plants closely and consider implementing the suggested treatments.\n- Consult with an agricultural advisor for tailored advice based on your soil and crop conditions.",

Magnesium can be applied directly to the soil or through foliar sprays.\n\n2. **Potassium Deficiency** (Likelihood: Unlikely)\n   - **Symptoms**: \n     - Yellowing of leaves starting from the margins.\n     - Main veins remain dark green.\n     - Curled leaves and stunted growth.\n   - **Treatment**: \n     - Use fertilizers containing potassium (e.g., muriate of potash, potassium nitrate).\n     - Consult with an agricultural advisor for the best product and dosage.\n   - **Recommendation**: Apply fertilizers during field preparation and at flowering, as crops absorb potassium more efficiently through soil fertilization.\n\n3. **Nitrogen Deficiency** (Likelihood: Very Unlikely)\n   - **Symptoms**: \n     - Discoloration of leaves (pale green, light red petioles and veins).\n     - Stunted leaf growth and long, thin appearance of the plant.\n   - **Treatment**: \n     - Use fertilizers containing nitrogen (e.g., Urea, NPK, ammonium nitrate).\n     - Consult with an agricultural advisor for the best product and dosage.\n   - **Recommendation**: Apply nitrogen in multiple splits throughout the season, avoiding application close to harvest time.\n\nPlease consider these recommendations and consult with an agricultural expert for tailored advice.",

Temperature Control: If you are in a greenhouse or controlled environment, you can increase the temperature slightly, but keep in mind that the plant does not get extreme conditions.\n\n5. Paste Management: You can leave the pests for some time to control them, but be careful not to stress them too much.\n\n6. **Monitoring**: Monitor the plant carefully. If the plants are feeling too stressed, start giving them water and nutrients to recover quickly.\n\nWith these practices, you can put the plant in stress, but always keep in mind that the health of the plant should also be monitored. If you need help with a specific situation, let me know!",

Use insecticidal soap or neem oil if necessary.\n\n5. **Disease Management**: Watch for diseases like powdery mildew and downy mildew. Ensure good air circulation and avoid overhead watering.\n\n6. **Support**: Use trellises to support climbing varieties, which can improve air circulation and reduce disease risk.\n\n7. **Harvesting**: Pick cucumbers when they are firm and green, typically 6-8 inches long, to encourage continuous production.\n\nRegular monitoring and timely interventions will help ensure a healthy cucumber crop.",

If the crop is recently sown or pruning (छंटाई)  is done recently, the transpiration will be slow and moisture kpa will increase slowly. If evaporation is slow or temperature have dropped on rainfall has happened, it will increase slowly. The chatbot needs to check the temperature , rainfall and crop stage data. And advise if there is any reason for the slow increase.\nIf still there is some confusion, the chatbot needs to ask user to check moisture around the sensor by digging and then ask  the user if he wants to create an issue ticket for the same.",

You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault. If the soil moisture sensor reading is consistently at 0 from few 48 hours, then it could be anamolous (use live and historical hourly soil moisture data (use tool) to validate)."

Here's a general approach to calculate soil retention:\n\n1. **Determine Soil Texture**: Identify the soil texture (e.g., sandy, loamy, clayey) as it affects water retention capacity.\n\n2. **Use Soil Retention Curves**: Soil retention curves provide data on how much water different soil types can hold at various moisture levels. You can find these curves in agricultural research or soil science literature.\n\n3. **Calculate Field Capacity and Wilting Point**:\n   - **Field Capacity**: The amount of water soil can hold after excess water has drained away (usually around 0.1 to 0.3 bar tension).\n   - **Wilting Point**: The moisture level at which plants can no longer extract water (usually around 1.5 bar tension).\n\n4. **Soil Water Holding Capacity**: The difference between field capacity and wilting point gives you the available water capacity (AWC):\n   \\[\n   \\text{AWC} = \\text{Field Capacity} - \\text{Wilting Point}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Estimate Soil Retention**: The total soil retention can be estimated based on the depth of the root zone and the AWC:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Soil Retention} = \\text{AWC} \\times \\text{Root Depth}\n   \\]\n\nIf you have specific values for your soil type or need further assistance, please provide those details!",

These disorders can affect plant growth, development, and fruit quality.\n\n### Common Causes of Physiological Disorders:\n1. **Nutrient Deficiencies**: Lack of essential nutrients can lead to various disorders, such as blossom end rot in tomatoes due to calcium deficiency.\n2. **Environmental Stress**: Factors like extreme temperatures, humidity, drought, or excessive rainfall can cause physiological disorders.\n3. **Water Stress**: Irregular watering practices can lead to issues like fruit splitting or blossom drop.\n4. **Soil Conditions**: Poor soil structure, pH imbalances, or salinity can also contribute to physiological disorders.\n\n### Examples of Physiological Disorders:\n- **Black Splitting** in bananas\n- **Blossom End Rot** in tomatoes\n- **Sunscald** in fruits\n- **Fruit Drop** in various crops\n\nManaging physiological disorders typically involves improving cultural practices, ensuring proper nutrient management, and monitoring environmental conditions to create a more favorable growing environment.",

And advise if there is any reason for the slow increase.\nIf still there is some confusion, the chatbot needs to ask user to check moisture around the sensor by digging and then ask  the user if he wants to create an issue ticket for the same.",
            "Q: The moisture (kpa) is increasing very fast  recently and it is asking to irrigate frequently.\nA:  Kpa is increasing fast it means that sensors are drying rapidly.  The chatbot needs to :\nCheck the actual kpa increase rate if it's higher now  in comparison to the previous weeks. If there no , tell the user that kPa increase is normal.\nIf there is rapid increase recently, check if the crop stag is near full fruit growth or harvesting. In the later stages , crop transpiration is very high , thus there is a rapid increase in soil moisture Kpa meaning decrease in moisture in the soil. Also, the moisture drop can be due to high evaporation recently. Check if there is temperature increase meaning high evaporation recently.\nIf the above two are not the cases, ask user to check the moisture physically near the sensor. If the actual moisture is wet near the sensor and the sensor is showing dry, the sensor might be worn out. In this case , ask if the user wants to raise a ticket with the support team."

            "Q: How do I know if my soil  moisture sensor is working fine ?\nA: The only way to know is if after irrigation the sensor is dropping below 5 kpa and increasing continuously unless next irrigation is done. You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault. If the soil moisture sensor reading is consistently at 0 from few 48 hours, then it could be anamolous (use live and historical hourly soil moisture data (use tool) to validate).",
            "Q: How to calibrate soil moisture sensors ?\nA:  The way to calibrate sensors is by putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. A drop after watering or irrigation and continuous dry upto 200 kpa means that the sensor is calibrated.",
            "Q: What should I do if the soil moisture sensor values fluctuate?\nA: Ensure the sensor is installed properly in the soil, check for air bubbles, and contact Fyllo representative if the issue persists.",
            "Q: Sensor is showing wet, i.e. less kpa but soil looks dry.\nA: The sensor measures the moisture around the rootzone which is not visible from the top. Ask use to check the moisture in rootzone around the sensor. If it matches, ask the user to irrigate.",
            "Q: Sensor is showing dry, but it rained recently.\nA: Rainwater doesn't percolate well in the soil. Most of it runs off. After a day of rain stops , if the sensor is still dry, you will have to irrigate. You can check the moisture by digging near the sensor . Irrigate accordingly."

You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault. If the soil moisture sensor reading is consistently at 0 from few 48 hours, then it could be anamolous (use live and historical hourly soil moisture data (use tool) to validate).",

            "Q: How to measure/ calculate irrigation hours /water tank of my plot in fyllo app? How do I calculate irrigation hours for my plot? How to use the irrigation hours calculator?\nA: To calculate irrigation hours in the Fyllo app, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the Fyllo App\n2. Go to the home screen\n3. Click on the soil moisture-1 sensor\n4. Scroll down to find the \"Irrigation hours\" section\n5. Fill in the required details such as:\n   - Root width (inches)\n   - Root depth (inches)\n   - Soil retention (mm)\n   - Dripper distance (feet)\n   - Dripper discharge (liters)\n6. Click the calculate button\n\nWould you like me to calculate the irrigation hours for you right now? I can retrieve your plot's irrigation settings and perform the calculation if you say yes.\n\nTool Selection: When user says yes, I should:\n1. Use get_irrigation_installation_settings tool to retrieve plot settings\n2. Check if all values are present and valid\n3. If values are valid, use calculate_irrigation_hours tool with these values\n4. If values are missing or invalid, ask the user to provide the missing values\n5. After calculating irrigation hours, display the irrigation installation settings that were used for the calculation\n6. Ask the user if they want to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values, and if yes, prompt them to provide those values\n\nExample response if values are missing:\n\"I checked your plot settings, but I need some additional information to calculate irrigation hours accurately. Could you please provide the [missing value(s)]? Once you provide these details, I can complete the calculation for you.\"\n\nExample response after calculation:\n\"Based on your plot's irrigation settings, the calculated irrigation hours are [X] hours. \n\nI used the following settings for this calculation:\n- Root width: [value] inches\n- Root depth: [value] inches\n- Soil retention: [value] mm\n- Dripper distance: [value] feet\n- Dripper discharge: [value] liters\n\nWould you like to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values?

            "Q: How to measure/ calculate irrigation hours /water tank of my plot in fyllo app? How do I calculate irrigation hours for my plot? How to use the irrigation hours calculator?\nA: To calculate irrigation hours in the Fyllo app, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the Fyllo App\n2. Go to the home screen\n3. Click on the soil moisture-1 sensor\n4. Scroll down to find the \"Irrigation hours\" section\n5. Fill in the required details such as:\n   - Root width (inches)\n   - Root depth (inches)\n   - Soil retention (mm)\n   - Dripper distance (feet)\n   - Dripper discharge (liters)\n6. Click the calculate button\n\nWould you like me to calculate the irrigation hours for you right now? I can retrieve your plot's irrigation settings and perform the calculation if you say yes.\n\nTool Selection: When user says yes, I should:\n1. Use get_irrigation_installation_settings tool to retrieve plot settings\n2. Check if all values are present and valid\n3. If values are valid, use calculate_irrigation_hours tool with these values\n4. If values are missing or invalid, ask the user to provide the missing values\n5. After calculating irrigation hours, display the irrigation installation settings that were used for the calculation\n6. Ask the user if they want to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values, and if yes, prompt them to provide those values\n\nExample response if values are missing:\n\"I checked your plot settings, but I need some additional information to calculate irrigation hours accurately. Could you please provide the [missing value(s)]? Once you provide these details, I can complete the calculation for you.\"\n\nExample response after calculation:\n\"Based on your plot's irrigation settings, the calculated irrigation hours are [X] hours. \n\nI used the following settings for this calculation:\n- Root width: [value] inches\n- Root depth: [value] inches\n- Soil retention: [value] mm\n- Dripper distance: [value] feet\n- Dripper discharge: [value] liters\n\nWould you like to calculate irrigation hours with a different set of values? If yes, please provide the new values you'd like to use.\""

            "Q: How do I know if my soil  moisture sensor is working fine ?\nA: The only way to know is if after irrigation the sensor is dropping below 5 kpa and increasing continuously unless next irrigation is done. You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault. If the soil moisture sensor reading is consistently at 0 from few 48 hours, then it could be anamolous (use live and historical hourly soil moisture data (use tool) to validate).",
            "Q: Sensor is showing wet, i.e. less kpa but soil looks dry.\nA: The sensor measures the moisture around the rootzone which is not visible from the top. Ask use to check the moisture in rootzone around the sensor. If it matches, ask the user to irrigate.",
            "Q: How to calibrate soil moisture sensors ?\nA:  The way to calibrate sensors is by putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. A drop after watering or irrigation and continuous dry upto 200 kpa means that the sensor is calibrated.",
            "Q: In the latest irrigation , sensor didn't drop to 0.\nA: 0 to 5 Kpa means soil is fully wet. It need not drop to 0 every time. Moisture less than 5 also means wet conditions. So, need not worry. Also ask to wait for 12 hours after irrigation."

You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault.

You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault. If the soil moisture sensor reading is consistently at 0 from few 48 hours, then it could be anamolous (use live and historical hourly soil moisture data (use tool) to validate)."

If necessary, create drainage channels to direct excess water away from the roots.\n   - **Raised Beds**: If waterlogging is a recurring issue, consider planting in raised beds to improve drainage.\n\n3. **Fertilization**:\n   - **Balanced Fertilizer**: Apply a balanced fertilizer to provide essential nutrients that may be lacking due to water saturation. This can help stimulate shoot growth.\n\n4. **Monitor Soil Moisture**:\n   - **Check Soil Moisture Levels**: Use a moisture meter to ensure that the soil is not overly saturated. Wait for the soil to dry out to optimal moisture levels before further irrigation.\n\n5. **Pest and Disease Management**:\n   - **Inspect for Pests/Diseases**: After heavy rainfall, check for any signs of pests or diseases that may affect shoot growth. Treat accordingly.\n\n6. **Mulching**:\n   - **Apply Mulch**: Use organic mulch to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and improve soil structure over time.\n\nBy implementing these practices, you can enhance soil aeration and support healthy shoot development in your grape crop.",

            "Q: How do I know if my soil  moisture sensor is working fine ?\nA: The only way to know is if after irrigation the sensor is dropping below 5 kpa and increasing continuously unless next irrigation is done. You can try putting water on the sensor and it should drop. Also, there should not be any fluctuations in the soil moisture data and the pressure kpa should always be increasing. Also, a soil moisture reading of 0 kPa is perfectly fine, meaning wet soil, but a reading of 200 kPa could mean fault. If the soil moisture sensor reading is consistently at 0 from few 48 hours, then it could be anamolous (use live and historical hourly soil moisture data (use tool) to validate).",
            "Q: Sensor is showing wet, i.e. less kpa but soil looks dry.\nA: The sensor measures the moisture around the rootzone which is not visible from the top. Ask use to check the moisture in rootzone around the sensor. If it matches, ask the user to irrigate.",
            "Q: How can the sensor monitor the whole plot when it's installed near one plant?\nA: The installation process includes a detailed survey of the plot regarding variations in soil type and root zone.

            "Q: Sensor is showing dry, but it rained recently.\nA: Rainwater doesn't percolate well in the soil. Most of it runs off. After a day of rain stops , if the sensor is still dry, you will have to irrigate. You can check the moisture by digging near the sensor . Irrigate accordingly.",
            "Q: Where can I add soil, leaf, or petiole test reports in the app?\nA: You can add test reports in two ways:\n\n    1. When creating a new report: Go to \"Fertigation,\" then \"Create Report,\" and input the details from your test results.\n    2. Upload copies: You can directly upload photocopies or scans of your test reports in the app. Look for an \"Upload Reports\" or similar option in the Fertigation section."

Here are some key points about sorghum farming:\n\n1. **Soil Requirements**: Sorghum thrives in well-drained, loamy soils with good organic matter. It can tolerate poor soil conditions but performs best in fertile soils.\n\n2. **Sowing Time**: The ideal time for sowing sorghum in India is during the Kharif season (June to July) and Rabi season (October to November), depending on the region.\n\n3. **Seed Rate**: The recommended seed rate is about 8-12 kg per acre, depending on the variety and soil fertility.\n\n4. **Fertilization**: A balanced fertilizer application is crucial. Typically, 20-25 kg of nitrogen, 40-50 kg of phosphorus, and 20-25 kg of potassium per acre are recommended.\n\n5. **Irrigation**: Sorghum is drought-resistant but requires adequate moisture during the critical growth stages. Irrigation should be done based on soil moisture levels.\n\n6. **Pest and Disease Management**: Common pests include shoot fly, stem borer, and aphids. Regular monitoring and timely application of pesticides are essential. Diseases like downy mildew and ergot can also affect yields.\n\n7. **Harvesting**: Sorghum is usually ready for harvest 90-120 days after sowing, depending on the variety. Harvest when the grains are hard and the leaves start to dry.\n\n8. **Uses**: Sorghum is used for food, fodder, and biofuel. It is a staple food in many regions and is rich in nutrients.\n\nIf you need specific guidance or have questions about sorghum farming practices, feel free to ask!",

Here are some specific practices for cultivating sorghum as fodder:\n\n1. **Variety Selection**: Choose fodder-specific varieties of sorghum, such as Sudan grass or forage sorghum, which are bred for high biomass and digestibility.\n\n2. **Soil Preparation**: Prepare the soil by plowing and harrowing to create a fine seedbed. Ensure good drainage and incorporate organic matter to improve soil fertility.\n\n3. **Sowing Time**: The best time to sow sorghum for fodder is during the Kharif season (June to July) or Rabi season (October to November), depending on your region.\n\n4. **Seed Rate**: Use a seed rate of about 10-15 kg per acre for fodder production. This higher density helps in achieving better biomass.\n\n5. **Fertilization**: Apply balanced fertilizers based on soil tests. Generally, 30-40 kg of nitrogen, 20-30 kg of phosphorus, and 20-30 kg of potassium per acre are recommended for optimal growth.\n\n6. **Irrigation**: Sorghum is drought-tolerant but requires adequate moisture during the early growth stages. Irrigate based on soil moisture levels, especially during dry spells.\n\n7. **Pest and Disease Management**: Monitor for pests like aphids and stem borers. Use integrated pest management practices, including biological control and timely pesticide application. Diseases like downy mildew should also be monitored.\n\n8. **Harvesting**: For fodder, sorghum can be harvested when it reaches a height of about 3-4 feet, usually 60-90 days after sowing. Cut the plants at the base to encourage regrowth.\n\n9. **Regrowth**: Sorghum has good regrowth potential. After the first cut, allow the plants to regrow for subsequent cuts, which can be done every 4-6 weeks.\n\n10. **Nutritional Value**: Sorghum fodder is rich in protein and energy, making it suitable for livestock feed. It can be fed fresh or preserved as silage.\n\nBy following these practices, you can effectively cultivate sorghum for fodder, ensuring a sustainable and nutritious feed source for your livestock.
