get_fertigation_schedule  
Checks the farmer's crop stages and requirements with internal petiole reports and gives the current week fertigation schedule details, and details of the next fertigation schedule (could be next week in the same crop stage or in next crop stage) for the plots. Fertilizers are given by 3 distribution methods:  
- Fertigation: fertilizers put into the irrigation pipeline itself  
- Foliar: on the leaves using a foliar spray  
- Soil: directly on the soil  
If the unit of fertilizer amount includes "per acre", then it is for 1 acre. Otherwise it is for "units per 1 plant".

Retrieves historical hourly soil moisture data from soil moisture sensors, in kPa or percentage. Provides soilMoisture1 and soilMoisture2 fields only. Suitable for less than 5 days duration.
###
get_historical_growing_degree_days  
Calculates and retrieves historical growing degree days (GDD) data from all plots for the given date range.
###
get_historical_daily_evapotranspiration  
Calculates and retrieves historical evapotranspiration (eto) data from the plots for the given date range.
###
get_irrigation_forecast  
Gives the irrigation requirement forecast for any day, today and beyond. Dates are mandatory. Output is humanized with day of the week and optimal moisture details if suitable.
###
get_farmer_activities  
Retrieves the past farmer activities from the provided plots for the given date range.
###
get_disease_pest_schedule  
Retrieves the farmer's current and past pesticide-related spray recommendations with spray details, based on dates. Dates are mandatory.
###
get_historical_disease_prediction_metrics  
Returns the historical daily crop disease prediction metrics for the given diseases, checking all dependent parameters inherently.
###
get_historical_pest_prediction_metrics  
Returns the historical daily crop pest prediction metrics for the given pests, checking all dependent parameters inherently.
###
get_specific_fertigation_requirements  
Finds the fertigation requirements for the plots with a particular crop stage and week numbers.
###
analyse_crop_image  
Gets the analysis of the uploaded crop image for any diseases or pests.
###
get_soil_moisture_percentage_from_kpa_reading  
Gets the estimated soil moisture percentage for a given plot and kPa reading.
###
get_soil_moisture_sensor_depth  
Returns the depths in inches of the soil moisture sensors 1 and 2 installed on the plots.
###
should_i_give_water  
Checks the current and optimal soil moisture values and decides whether the farmer should give water to the plot now or today.
###
raise_support_ticket  
Raises a support ticket for the given plot. Dharti decides the priority and message based on the conversation.
###
get_irrigation_installation_settings
    retrieves the irrigation installation settings in the farmer's plots, can be used to calculate the irrigation hours.
    returns root_width, root_depth, soil_retention, dripper_distance, dripper_discharge
###
calculate_irrigation_hours
Calculate the irrigation hours needed for irrigation by the farmer based on the mandatory provided values.
    The formula used is
    (root_width * root_depth * soil_retention * dripper_distance * calc_constant) / dripper_discharge
    where calc_constant = 0.00006784244
